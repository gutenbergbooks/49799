<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">WHEN THE AMBULANCE CAME.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be all right now, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one I&rsquo;m glad to be relieved from
these onerous duties, as sure as my name&rsquo;s
Billy Worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to Billy talk, just as if the whole
burden had been resting on <i>his</i> shoulders,
when everybody knows Arthur Cameron and
our efficient scout master, Hugh Hardin, have
done about all the tough work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Alec, but it&rsquo;s made me tired
watching them hurrying from one patient to
another. Then again, mebbe it&rsquo;s partly because
I&rsquo;m not used to being in a field hospital
anyway, and my nerves are getting shaky under
the terrific strain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have it as you will, boys, but just the same
every one of us is happy to see that Red Cross
ambulance coming down the road from Farmingdale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them three cheers, Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six well-battered campaign hats, such as
Boy Scouts almost invariably delight in wearing,
were waved energetically in the air, and
as many pairs of lusty young lungs roared out
a salvo of welcome.</p>
<p>It was a most remarkable scene which that
half-dozen wearers of the honored khaki
looked upon at the time those cheers rang out.
For the special benefit of those readers who
may not have enjoyed reading the preceding
books of this series, a little explanation may
not come in amiss while the boys are awaiting
the arrival of the oncoming ambulance.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>These boys belonged in the New England
town of Oakvale, and most of them were members
of the Wolf Patrol of the local troop.
They had started out in the early summer for
a camping trip, having also members of other
patrols with them&mdash;the Hawk, the Otter, the
Fox and the Owl&mdash;numbering some fourteen
in all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Pitching their tents on the bank of the roaring
Hurricane, in a section of country where
they had never been before, they proceeded to
enjoy themselves after the fashion of scouts&mdash;every
one according to his own pleasure&mdash;although
at the same time a certain amount
of authority was exercised by the acting scout
master.</p>
<p>A variety of adventures fell to their lot
which have been faithfully recorded in the
pages of the preceding volume; they should
prove interesting reading to all lads with red
blood in their veins.</p>
<p>It developed that they had camped within
a couple of miles of a large plant or cement
works where a couple of hundred men, mostly
foreigners, had been employed.</p>
<p>On account of dull times the owner of the
works had thought fit to reduce the wages of
his employees, and in consequence there had
been a strike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>As so frequently happens in such cases
where feeling runs high, the owner of the
plant, upon finding that his old men would not
return to work, hired guards to protect the
buildings, while he imported a new lot of
strike-breakers whose presence excited the foreigners
and promised trouble.</p>
<p>The boys in camp had learned something
about this, and Hugh Hardin was seen to
listen many times when certain sounds came
on the wind blowing from the quarter where
he knew the plant was located.</p>
<p>Finally, one morning shortly after breakfast
they had heard the sound of numerous gunshots,
and much loud shouting. This told
them what they had been fearing must have
happened, and that a terrible battle between
the strikers and the guards had come to pass.</p>
<p>Scouts above all things are always looking
about for opportunities to make themselves
useful to their fellow beings; and it now occurred
to Hugh Hardin that they would never
forgive themselves if they did not proceed to
render &ldquo;first aid to the injured&rdquo; to any of
the wretched foreigners who may have been
shot during the riot that had taken place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Accordingly, after consulting with his
chums, the scout master selected five of whom
he wished to accompany him on his errand of
mercy. Of course, in picking these members
of Oakvale troop, Hugh considered their
availability along the line of knowledge of surgery
in its first principles as well as their ability
to handle a stretcher in case such should
be needed.</p>
<p>So they had hastened across country and
arrived on the scene to find that their worst
fears were realized. Several badly wounded
men had already been helped back to the settlement
where these foreigners lived in shacks
and even tents. Others, to an unknown number,
were said to be lying on the ground where
they had fallen at the time they tried to rush
the guards, who shot them down by a murderous
fire.</p>
<p>Besides Hugh Hardin and his stout, good-natured
chum, Billy Worth, there were present
Arthur Cameron, said to be the best hand
at surgery in the troop, Alec Sands, Bud Morgan
and Ralph Kenyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>They had managed with the aid of a rude
stretcher made from a mattress tick obtained
from the padrone of the foreign settlement to
carry the last of the badly wounded strikers
to the temporary field hospital which had been
started under a tree. There were a couple
of women patients as well, for in that rush
toward the gates of the stockade surrounding
the cement works, the women had urged
on their husbands, just as the Amazons outvied
all others during the Revolution in Paris
long ago.</p>
<p>Here the six boys had labored, and tried to
do all they could to relieve the suffering of
those wretched victims of the riot, some of
whom were injured so badly that Hugh and
Arthur feared for their lives.</p>
<p>Wisely foreseeing that they had a greater
task cut out for them than it would appear lay
within the province of Boy Scouts, with their
limited knowledge of surgery, Hugh from the
beginning had determined to seek assistance.</p>
<p>It happened that just then the Red Cross
movement in the State was receiving an impetus,
and those deeply interested in the advance
of the cause of mercy were holding some
sort of a convention in the city of Farmingdale,
not a great many miles away from the
pitiful little field hospital which Hugh and his
mates had organized under such discouraging
conditions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Hugh understood that at this convention
there was to be shown one of the very newest
motor ambulances, together with its regular
traveling doctor and two nurses of the Red
Cross.</p>
<p>It was feared that those in charge of the
works might delay sending off an account of
the battle, and hence help would be slow in
coming. Accordingly, Hugh Hardin, with his
accustomed zeal, had conceived the idea of
telegraphing direct to the Red Cross at Farmingdale.
He had explained in brief language
what a terrible condition of affairs prevailed,
and begged that they dispatch their new motor
ambulance forthwith, in order to save the lives
of several whose cases were beyond the limited
capabilities of the scouts.</p>
<p>As the boys, though never slackening their
arduous duties, had been watching eagerly for
much more than an hour after this urgent message
had been dispatched, it can easily be understood
why they should hail the appearance
of that oncoming ambulance with hearty
cheers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, you can see the surgeon all in white
sitting beside the chauffeur!&rdquo; exclaimed Alec
Sands, as they gathered in a cluster and anxiously
awaited the coming of those who would
relieve them from the weight of care pressing
so heavily on their young shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I c&rsquo;n also see two nurses, also in
snowy garments, peeping out back of the surgeon,&rdquo;
added Billy Worth.</p>
<p>The foreigners were wildly excited. Of
course most of them had never before set eyes
on a Red Cross ambulance, and they hardly
knew whether they should allow the strangers
to take their wounded away, or to resist them.
They rushed this way and that, all the while
talking at a furious rate, until as Ralph Kenyon,
who had always been a lover of the woods,
declared it reminded him of a crow caucus,
where a thousand birds cawed and scolded and
clamored.</p>
<p>The ambulance drew up close to where the
six scouts stood, as though the one at the
wheel recognized them as being in authority;
or it may be the surgeon saw the significant
signs of a field hospital in the figures scattered
on dirty blankets under the shade of that
wide-spreading oak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which one of you sent that message,
boys?&rdquo; asked the surgeon, a young energetic
man, who looked as though he knew his business;
and as the other five scouts immediately
turned their eyes toward Hugh, he understood,
so he went on to say: &ldquo;From another source
news came in that many were seriously injured,
and a few killed outright. Is that a
fact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as we have been able to find out,
sir, there were no actual fatalities,&rdquo; Hugh told
him, &ldquo;though several are badly hurt, having
been shot in the back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say&mdash;shot in the back?&rdquo;
demanded the surgeon quickly. &ldquo;That is a
significant admission which may have considerable
bearing on the finding of a coroner&rsquo;s
jury in case death results. But show me what
you have been doing in this emergency, my
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had hardly any facilities worth mentioning,
you understand, sir,&rdquo; remarked Arthur
Cameron, &ldquo;and a number of the patients
had to be carried from the place where they
were hurt to this amateur field hospital. We
made a stretcher, you see, for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;And well done at that. I&rsquo;ll be bound it answered
the purpose as well as the up-to-date
one connected with the ambulance!&rdquo; cried the
astonished Red Cross surgeon.</p>
<p>He went from one patient to another and
examined the work of the scouts. Loud was
his praise for the cleverness shown by Arthur
Cameron. While doubtless in many things it
was far from the finished product of a graduated
surgeon, at the same time there was much
about it to cause the surgeon to commend the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you, my boy,&rdquo; he said directly
to the blushing Arthur, when Hugh informed
him that most of the work had been done by
that modest member of the scout troop, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
make the mistake of your life if you fail to
continue along this road, for you have it in
you to accomplish wonders. Take my advice,
and think very seriously before you commit
the blunder of putting a square man in a round
hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, that was very pleasant talk for
Arthur, and his chums seemed to take quite as
much delight in hearing him praised as though
they themselves came within the scope of the
surgeon&rsquo;s flattery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>They watched how deftly he worked when
examining the wounds that had been already
treated, turning most of the ordinary cases
over to the two nurses. Hugh learned, as he
chatted with the other, that the young surgeon&rsquo;s
name was Doctor Richter, and the attendants
of the ambulance were Nurse Arnold
and Nurse Jones.</p>
<p>The former was a middle-aged woman who
had doubtless had much experience in her line;
but Nurse Jones, Hugh found, was rather
young and with rosy cheeks, as well as bright
eyes. As a rule the scout master paid very
little attention to the looks of girls, but somehow,
in this case, he found himself more or less
interested in the two women whose sleeves
bore the magic insignia of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>When presently they came to one of the poor
fellows who had received so serious a wound,
the boys waited with more or less concern
while the surgeon made his examination.
Hugh could see that he looked grave, and this
fact convinced him of the seriousness of the
case. It also told the scout master that he
had acted wisely in wiring to the Red Cross
to send help, so as to relieve the inexperienced
scouts from further responsibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is in a bad way,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Richter,
as he bent back toward Hugh. &ldquo;It would be
little short of downright murder to carry him
back over those rough roads, even in our splendid
ambulance. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to make
an emergency hospital out of it here if, as
you say, there are several more cases like this.
Those who can stand the trip may be taken
away, with one of the nurses in charge; the
other I will keep by me for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went from one to another, and Dr.
Richter was pleased to continue saying how
delighted he felt over the fact that boys could
make themselves so useful in case of need like
that which had arisen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does you great credit in the first place,
let me tell you, Mr. Scout Master,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that you and your chums decided to hurry
over here on the run to lend a helping hand.
I never fully understood what the Boy Scout
movement stood for up to now; but after seeing
what you have done, from this time on it
is going to have my unqualified approval.
Wherever I can, I shall tell just how I was
converted to standing up for such a noble purpose
in life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another cloud of dust up the road
yonder, Hugh,&rdquo; said Alec at this interesting
juncture. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all wondering whether a
second ambulance corps could have been sent
out from some other town to render aid. If
it happens that way they might as well turn
around and go back home; for first come first
served, you know, and we&rsquo;ve turned everything
over to the Red Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see a couple of big touring cars,&rdquo; ventured
Billy Worth, &ldquo;and say, they seem to be
full of men at that. If they&rsquo;re all doctors and
nurses we&rsquo;ll be fairly swamped with workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man in the leading car seems to have
some sort of a silver badge pinned on his
breast,&rdquo; remarked Alec. &ldquo;I tell you what it
means, boys; p&rsquo;raps he&rsquo;s the big officer of the
county, the sheriff; and that&rsquo;s a posse he&rsquo;s
sworn in to accompany him here to keep the
peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alec, you&rsquo;ve hit it square on the head
that time,&rdquo; added Ralph Kenyon, excitedly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what those men are&mdash;a sheriff&rsquo;s
posse!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Bud Morgan, &ldquo;I just heard
the padrone here, who is in charge of these
foreigners, say that man with the gray mustache
is Mr. Campertown, who owns the cement
works. They&rsquo;re not feeling very kindly
toward him, and perhaps it&rsquo;s as well that he
comes here protected by a sheriff&rsquo;s armed
posse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what d&rsquo;ye think they mean to do?&rdquo;
asked Billy Worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take charge of the situation,&rdquo; replied
Hugh, promptly. &ldquo;It may be the governor has
been appealed to by some one, and has given
the sheriff authority to order the guards out
of the barricade. He may even be meaning
to arrest them on some charge or other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The two big touring cars stopped close by,
and the man who seemed to be in authority
strode up to the spot where the scouts, as well
as Dr. Richter, stood. He gave a glance
toward the emergency hospital under the oak,
and his look was grave as he addressed the
surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from, Doctor?&rdquo; he
asked, noticing, of course, the fact that the
ambulance was marked with that significant
Red Cross that told its story better than mere
words could have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Farmingdale,&rdquo; replied the Red Cross
surgeon, &ldquo;where a convention was in progress
when we received a wire sent by these fine
boys here, begging us to come and relieve them
from the duty of taking care of the many who
were injured in the riot that resembled a massacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gruff-looking sheriff raised his bushy
eyebrows and surveyed Hugh and his comrades
with sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me these kids were
handling such cases when you came on the
scene?&rdquo; he demanded, with an incredulous
stare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;and nobly,&rdquo; the other assured
him. &ldquo;Not only have they taken the first
necessary steps to stop the loss of life blood,
but they have made that very good stretcher,
and carried several of the badly injured from
the front of the plant over here under the
shade of this tree. The lads are deserving
of the greatest praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certainly surprised, and pleased as
well,&rdquo; said the sheriff, nodding in the direction
of the boys. &ldquo;Were there any fatalities, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand none up to the present,&rdquo; replied
the surgeon. &ldquo;We have, however, several
cases so serious that I would not like to
predict a favorable outcome, though everything
possible will be done to pull them through.
They were shot <i>in the back</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Hugh that when Dr. Richter
made this last startling remark he looked
straight at the man with the white mustache,
who, still sitting in one of the automobiles,
had been listening earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, Doctor; shot <i>in the
back</i>? That&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; was what the sheriff exclaimed.
Hugh, watching Mr. Campertown,
saw that he had turned pale and moved uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Just then Hugh noticed there was a handsome
little chap of about three years of age
close beside the rich owner of the plant; he
imagined that it might possibly be a grandchild,
for Mr. Campertown seemed to be a man
of at least fifty. How it happened that he had
brought the child with him on such an errand
fraught with danger Hugh could not guess;
but it happened that just then the sheriff took
it upon himself to explain this part of the
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Campertown, the owner of the
plant,&rdquo; he told Dr. Richter. &ldquo;He was on the
road when his car broke down, and as we came
along and he heard about what had happened
up here he asked us to bring him with us. We
mean to stop this foolish business before more
blood is shed, if we have to bundle out every
one of those hired guards, and take charge of
the safety of the plant ourselves. The majesty
of the law must be upheld, no matter who
suffers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>With that he re&euml;ntered his car, and both vehicles
moved off toward the works, leaving
the strikers talking excitedly among themselves.
Evidently many of the most turbulent
among them were for trying to wreak summary
vengeance on the man whom they held
responsible for the shooting. It took considerable
fervid oratory on the part of the discrete
padrone to convince them that such a
step would be a most foolish one, since it must
alienate public sympathy, and result in landing
some of them in jail.</p>
<p>Dr. Richter paid no more attention to what
might happen over at the plant. It mattered
nothing to him if those armed guards were
thrust out, and told to depart. He was concerned
only with the taking care of the wounded
strikers, and of the women who had also
been in the crowd when that murderous fire
was turned upon them after they had been
warned to disperse, and had not moved fast
enough to please the armed bullies who, from
their defenses, had opened upon them with
such disastrous results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we must open an emergency hospital
here,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Richter to Hugh and
Arthur, who stuck close to his side, &ldquo;we ought
to find out if there is any sort of suitable building
in this collection of shacks and small
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to mention the fact, Doctor,&rdquo;
suggested Hugh, &ldquo;that I saw a frame building
which I think must be used for a school. It
seemed to me that it could be made to serve
the purpose, if cleaned out in a hurry. Shall
I sound the padrone about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will, Hugh,&rdquo; replied the other, with
a smile, which showed what faith he had in
the ability of the young scout master to accomplish
things, founded on what he had already
seen done.</p>
<p>It was quickly arranged with the old padrone,
who set a number of women to work
cleaning out the little schoolhouse. When this
had been accomplished they could remove the
most dangerously wounded to its shelter, and
then even though a storm should come on they
would not be exposed to the weather.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dr. Richter was making preparations
for removing several of the other injured
strikers to the hospital at Farmingdale,
where they could receive the proper treatment
free of all expense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>In this labor he was ably assisted by some of
the scouts, and it was settled that Nurse Arnold,
as the older and more experienced of the
attendants, should accompany the ambulance
with its load of suffering humanity to the distant
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you put a flea in the sheriff&rsquo;s ear,
Doctor, when you told him these people were
shot when they were running away,&rdquo; Hugh remarked,
as they stood and watched the ambulance
move along the road, to come back
again for another load later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just what I meant to do,&rdquo; replied
the other, seriously. &ldquo;I wanted to impress the
fact on him to start with, that it was not a battle,
but a massacre, for as far as we know all
the injuries are on the side of the strikers.
Then again, it struck me that a wealthy man
like that Mr. Campertown, who is a millionaire
I believe, ought to pay more attention to
what is being done in his name. Why, some
of these women could have torn his clothes
off if the padrone had not kept them in subjection.
They glared at the owner of the
works like tiger-cats, and I could see their
hands working as if they longed to lay hold of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh turned and looked at the several figures
still lying under the tree, and a big sigh
welled up from his very heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that what Mr.
Campertown has seen here to-day will open his
eyes to what his duty is toward those who
work for him. He has seen how horribly these
people have to live even with the wages they
used to get; and he must realize that it means
almost starvation for them to take what has
been offered lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if he knew what was best for him he
would do what some other employers have
done&mdash;even be satisfied to suffer a temporary
loss rather than cut the wages of their faithful
employees. I know several big-hearted
men who have done that same thing. They
say they can stand a loss for a time, but their
men could not. It would hardly be safe for
Mr. Campertown to wander over this way
while the strikers are so furious, or to let that
handsome little grandson of his get away from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that was his grandchild?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
&ldquo;He seemed to be as pretty a three-year-old
as I ever saw. Even the dago women
were staring at him, and then looking at their
own ragged and dirty children as if comparing
the lot of the two classes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Hugh felt a thrill pass over him when he
heard the surgeon say what he did. He, too,
had been very much taken with the rosy-cheeked
little chap who sat in the big touring
car alongside the owner of the cement plant.
It gave him a bad feeling to even think of
harm befalling such a fine lad through the desire
for revenge on the part of some of these
men or women who had seen their kind shot
down in cold blood by the paid deputies of
this same rich man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will never come to that,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell what some of these hot-blooded
foreigners will do,&rdquo; the surgeon replied.
&ldquo;They might think to get even with Mr.
Campertown, or it is even possible they would
try to make better terms with him by hiding
his little grandchild, and bargaining that way.
It&rsquo;s a common occurrence over in their country
to kidnap people, and hold them for a ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Hugh happened to see Alec beckoning
to him to approach, and so he wandered
over to where the other was standing along
with Bud Morgan, both of them having the
air of fellows who had come upon a mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">MASTER AND MEN.</span></h2>
<p>When Hugh joined the other scouts Alec
took him by the sleeve and after a cautious
glance around remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you something
this little while back, Hugh; but you seemed
to be so wrapped up with what Dr. Richter
was saying and doing that we&rsquo;ve just kept
waiting and waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, then, fellows?&rdquo; asked
the scout master wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that Nurse Jones must have known
Mr. Campertown before, we think, Hugh, by
the strange way she acted all the time he was
near by,&rdquo; replied Bud, anxious to do his part
of the talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t happen to notice her,&rdquo; Hugh told
them. &ldquo;I was too busy watching Mr. Campertown
myself, and that sheriff who means to
run things here from now on. Tell me what
the nurse did?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just seemed to try and cower back as
if she didn&rsquo;t want the rich man to notice her!&rdquo;
Alec hastened to say. &ldquo;Yes, she even fixed
her eyes on him and that pretty kid as though
she could eat one of them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else kill Mr. Campertown with a look,&rdquo;
added Bud. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was any love for
him that made her stare so, and want to keep
back out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t concern us that I can see whether
Nurse Jones ever knew that gentleman before
or not,&rdquo; he told the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not,&rdquo; admitted Bud, with a shrug
of his shoulders; &ldquo;but all the same it seems
queer that they should happen to meet, and
here of all places. I was hoping he would see
her, for I wanted to know how he&rsquo;d act, but
he was too much taken up looking at the field
hospital we arranged here. Then again, the
scowls on the faces of all these dagoes must
have given him a bad feeling, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since it&rsquo;s none of our affair, let&rsquo;s forget
about it then,&rdquo; Hugh told them. &ldquo;Nurse
Jones knows her business, and even her bright
face is enough in itself to help cheer a suffering
fellow up. Now that you&rsquo;re here wait until
I get the rest of the boys around, for I&rsquo;ve
got an idea I want to put before you all. If
you think as I do we can fix things that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This aroused the curiosity of the other two,
just as Hugh had expected would be the case.
They were compelled to wait, however, until
he had beckoned to Arthur and the other two,
who soon joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s all this deep, dark mystery
mean?&rdquo; demanded Billy Worth, as he joined
the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s got something to say to us, you
know,&rdquo; replied Alec. &ldquo;Now, please hit it up,
Mr. Scout Master! Are we going to hike back
to our jolly camp on the raging Hurricane
right away? I shall be sorry, because I&rsquo;m getting
head over ears interested in this Red
Cross work, and hoped we might stay around
a while longer so as to pick up a few more
pointers on how to do things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh smiled as he heard this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I guess I can count on your vote in
favor of the proposal I meant to make you
all,&rdquo; he told Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As what?&rdquo; asked Billy, eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking that I&rsquo;d dispatch a messenger
to the camp, and tell the rest of the fellows
what we&rsquo;ve struck over here. They
might break camp and head this way, to put
up the tents somewhere close by. Then all of
us could hang around and learn considerable
in the way of taking charge of wounded persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, Hugh!&rdquo; cried Billy enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Richter and Nurse Jones are mighty
kind about explaining just how things are
done, and why a certain way is best,&rdquo; declared
Ralph. &ldquo;Count on me as favoring the idea,
Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My answer goes without asking,&rdquo; remarked
Arthur, who was having the time of his life,
now that he had an opportunity to rub elbows
with a real Red Cross ambulance corps in operation,
and see with his own eyes how everything
was conducted with systematic exactness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the other fellows ought to have
a share in the lesson,&rdquo; admitted Ralph Kenyon,
without any hesitation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Move we make it unanimous, fellows?&rdquo;
suggested Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; the scout master told
them, looking satisfied, for he always liked to
know that he had the majority of his fellow
members with him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it settled, and,
Ralph, I appoint you and Alec a committee of
two to run back to camp and carry the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no frowning on the part of the
chosen pair. They seemed perfectly willing
to carry out the orders of their leader. Possibly
it occurred to the boys that there would,
after all, be considerable sport in astonishing
the other fellows with a graphic account of all
that had happened to them since they left
camp just after breakfast that same morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help them pack up, and the tents as well
as other heavy stuff that can be carried as
we did before&mdash;on poles dragged Indian fashion
with the other ends on the ground,&rdquo; Hugh
called out after the pair as they were immediately
starting forth on their errand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hugh, we understand,&rdquo; Alec
shouted back as he ran. &ldquo;I should think you
could look for us not more&rsquo;n two hours from
now. It may take some little while to get the
tents down, and things packed. So-long,
everybody. Hope there won&rsquo;t be any more action
until we get back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In doing this Hugh believed he was favoring
his comrades truly. They could enjoy the
delights of camping at almost any time, but
an opportunity to work in conjunction with
the Red Cross did not come every day, and
they would show their wisdom if they took advantage
of the golden chance.</p>
<p>All scouts are supposed to learn a certain
amount of surgical work, and what is known
as &ldquo;first aid to the injured&rdquo;; but it rests with
each individual as to whether or not he cares
to continue the study beyond a certain point.
If he feels a deep and abiding interest in this
noble work of assisting those in pain and suffering,
he can grasp such opportunities as come
his way to acquire further education along
those particular lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Hugh and Arthur were just such boys, and
there were several others whom the leader fancied
might be greatly benefited by contact
with Dr. Richter and the Red Cross nurses.
It was in hopes of awakening the smoldering
fire within the minds of these chums that Hugh
conceived the idea of having the entire camp
moved from the bank of the Hurricane to a
spot closer to the foreign settlement, where the
emergency hospital was about to be established.</p>
<p>When the little schoolhouse had been emptied
of its benches and desks and thoroughly
cleaned and disinfected according to the directions
of Dr. Richter, a fire was lighted in the
stove in order to dry the floor more quickly.</p>
<p>Finally cots were obtained through the influence
of the friendly padrone, and when these
had been arranged under the eye of Nurse
Jones, the place began to look somewhat like
what it was intended to be&mdash;a makeshift or
emergency hospital.</p>
<p>Here the wounded strikers were carefully
taken; and when those who crowded around
and gaped at everything that was done saw
how careful the scouts and the Red Cross people
were in trying to avoid giving more pain
than could be helped, they chattered volubly
among themselves, and even gave Hugh and
his chums what were meant to be friendly
smiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>It was well on toward eleven o&rsquo;clock when
Hugh discovered a procession coming along
the road. The main body of scouts were arriving,
carrying their luggage with them after
the manner of roving Indian families;
only, some of the boys, instead of having a
horse to drag the poles that sustained the
heavy stuff, were compelled to perform this
task.</p>
<p>Hugh had already decided that after the
boys had taken a look at things it would be
advisable for them to make camp at some little
distance away from the village of shacks.
There were several reasons for this, which
would doubtless be sufficiently convincing to
the other fellows, after they had been on the
ground a short time.</p>
<p>More than this, the scout master had even
taken a turn around with Billy Worth, and
picked out the site for the camp, which would
be sufficiently removed from the settlement,
and yet not so very far away, either, that most
of the boys could not hover around if it
pleased them so to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>There was no grumbling, at least that Hugh
detected. To be sure this alteration of their
plans interfered considerably with certain
things they may have laid out to do; but then
scouts learn to take what comes, and with a
cheery spirit meet conditions that may from
time to time arise.</p>
<p>At noon they were so far advanced in fixing
up their new camp that they had a cooked meal,
to which Hugh and the others, who had worked
so hard since early morning, certainly did full
justice.</p>
<p>They had learned that the sheriff had carried
out his threat, and that he must have convinced
Mr. Campertown that it was his duty
to discharge the paid and armed men who were
guarding his property, now that the regular
authorities had taken charge of matters.</p>
<p>Ralph Kenyon, who had been scouting
around in the vicinity of the plant, without
allowing himself to be seen, came in about dinner-time
with a report that gave Hugh considerable
satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think, fellows,&rdquo; he announced,
as flushed and panting for breath he burst
upon them while they were settling down to
having their midday meal. &ldquo;The whole pack
have got the grand bounce&mdash;the guards, I
mean, of course. Saw them slipping out on
the other side and going away in a bunch, guns
and all, like they didn&rsquo;t want the strikers to
know they were outside the breastworks, for
fear something might happen to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That begins to look as if we wouldn&rsquo;t have
any more cases to attend to, eh, boys?&rdquo; remarked
Dr. Richter, who with Nurse Jones
had accepted the warm invitation extended by
the scout master to join them in the meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if only they go away, and stay away,
there should be no more trouble,&rdquo; ventured
Hugh. &ldquo;If Mr. Campertown could only talk
with the old padrone, and see for himself how
little can be bought for the wages his men
have been earning in the past, he might hold
out the olive branch toward them. But I&rsquo;m
afraid from his looks that he&rsquo;s a pretty strong-willed
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow Hugh was looking out of the corner
of his eye toward Nurse Jones when he
made this assertion, and he plainly saw her
nod her head, as though from some good reason
of her own, which she did not choose everyone
to know, she could testify to this fact. It
caused Hugh to remember what Alec and the
other scout had said about Nurse Jones being
deeply interested in the owner of the plant and
his handsome little grandchild.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>After the meal was over many of the boys
went over to the settlement to watch what Dr.
Richter and Nurse Jones did on their rounds.
Then came the Red Cross ambulance again to
carry the rest of the wounded who could safely
be moved over the rough roads to the big hospital
at Farmingdale, where they would have
every possible attention.</p>
<p>Hugh noticed that Nurse Arnold handed
the padrone a crumpled piece of paper. She
said one of the injured men had written a note
after he had seen how splendidly they were to
be cared for; and the padrone looked very
much pleased when he had read its contents.</p>
<p>It was about two hours after the ambulance
with its second load had departed from the
camp that Ralph hurriedly sought Hugh,
with the alarming intelligence that he had seen
three of the discharged guards skulking along
on the other side of the cement plant, as
though they might have come back to make
trouble of some sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE WORK OF THE SCOUTS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this that you saw the discharged
guards?&rdquo; asked the scout master, after
Ralph had made his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over on the other side of the plant,&rdquo; came
the reply. &ldquo;You see I was just prowling
around, curious to discover what lay there, because
none of our fellows had bothered taking
a look at that side of the stockade, and I
wanted to know how they meant to defend it
in case of a rush from one or two hundred
strikers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all right, Ralph,&rdquo; Hugh told him;
&ldquo;though it&rsquo;s a wonder you didn&rsquo;t get a hail
from one of the sheriff&rsquo;s posse and be asked
what business you had looking around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;To go on with my story, Hugh, I want to
say that I don&rsquo;t think much of that same posse
of the sheriff. Why, he&rsquo;s just picked up a lot
of ordinary men in a hurry, and armed them
with guns and badges to back him up. They
might fight all right in a pinch, but let me tell
you they would never be able to guard that
plant against a troop of wideawake Boy
Scouts. Why, we could creep in on &rsquo;em while
they dozed at their posts, and first thing they
knew it would be &lsquo;hands up everybody; you&rsquo;re
IT!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh laughed at hearing Ralph speak in
this strain. He knew that the other was considered
an unusually clever scout, for which
his love of the woods and former business of
hunting and trapping game had especially fitted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a good word for all scouts
you&rsquo;re giving, Ralph,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And so it
was while you were sizing up the watchfulness
of the new guards that you discovered
the presence of the old ones, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I happened to be in a position to drop
down in the brush at the time, and they didn&rsquo;t
glimpse me for a cent,&rdquo; continued Ralph, with
an unconscious touch of pride in his voice.
&ldquo;They were all eyes for the plant, and I could
understand they didn&rsquo;t want to be seen by anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;d forgotten something, and
were returning to get it?&rdquo; suggested the scout
master, in order to draw the other out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; was Ralph&rsquo;s vigorous protest,
&ldquo;they acted too suspicious for that, I tell you,
Hugh. If they had wanted to get something
in an open and aboveboard way why wouldn&rsquo;t
they walk straight up to the gate and send word
to the sheriff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look a little that way,&rdquo; admitted
Hugh thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you asked me straight from the shoulder
what those sneaks were meaning to do,&rdquo; continued
the active scout, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say they expected
to steal something they knew was in the plant&mdash;something
worth while at that. For all we
know they may be crooks who took up with
the offer of big wages when Mr. Campertown&rsquo;s
manager sent word to the agency he wanted
guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps break into the safe of the company,
which they think may hold enough
money to pay them for their trouble; that&rsquo;s
what you mean, is it, Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something along those lines,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may turn out that way,&rdquo; Hugh told him
a little dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds as if you didn&rsquo;t take any too much
stock in my guess, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the scout master, &ldquo;when
you stop to consider that the sheriff of the
county is in charge of the plant now, and has
his posse standing guard with orders to shoot
any trespasser on sight, it doesn&rsquo;t strike me as
reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you think might be the
reason for their coming back, then?&rdquo; demanded
Ralph, somewhat disappointed because
the scout leader had failed to back him up in
his theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only give a guess at it,&rdquo; mused Hugh.
&ldquo;It seems to me as if the explanation might
be connected with the disgust and anger of
these guards at losing their fat job. They
may have talked it over, and sent these three
back to prowl around to see if something
couldn&rsquo;t be done to start trouble between the
posse and the strikers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I didn&rsquo;t think of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ralph. &ldquo;If such a thing happened it would
sort of gloss over their own crazy act in firing
on men when their backs were turned,
wouldn&rsquo;t it? If the sheriff had to fight to hold
his own after discharging them, it might make
the public excuse their terrible blunder. Hugh,
there may be a whole lot in what you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t try to follow those three guards,
of course, Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; grinned the other scout. &ldquo;It
was broad daylight, and, while I&rsquo;m a fair hand
at dodging after any fellow, I knew they&rsquo;d get
on to me right away. I just lay there in the
bushes and watched &rsquo;em go along. But, Hugh,
they sheered away from the plant before they
got out of my sight, so I&rsquo;m sure they never
walked up to the gate and made any request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I can do to try and keep
the peace,&rdquo; ventured Hugh, as though his own
suggestion might still be in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might that be?&rdquo; inquired the other,
curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try and have a talk with the old padrone,&rdquo;
the scout master informed him. &ldquo;You know
he can understand English all right, and he
speaks it after a fashion. If he were put on
his guard I think he would warn his men that
they must not under any conditions be drawn
into a dispute with armed parties pretending
to be members of the sheriff&rsquo;s posse, for these
men may try and play that smart game, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Dr. Richter, Hugh, and he&rsquo;s
got some pleasant news for you, if that smile
on his face stands for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Red Cross surgeon quickly joined the
two chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are already beginning to take a
turn for the better,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that the ones who are so
badly wounded will have a fair show to recover?&rdquo;
asked Hugh, feeling as though the
burden that had been weighing so heavily on
his own heart was being lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was hardly what I meant,&rdquo; admitted
the other, &ldquo;though so far as I can say
just now there&rsquo;s a fighting chance for them all,
and with reasonably good luck we&rsquo;ll pull them
through. But I&rsquo;ve just had a few lines from
Mr. Campertown over at the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something about the wounded men, I venture?&rdquo;
remarked Ralph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it was,&rdquo; the surgeon acceded.
&ldquo;It must be that the sight of them lying here
on these old faded blankets stirred him more
or less, especially when he remembered that
they had once been his faithful workers, and
that it was through the agency of men hired
with his money that they came to get these
severe injuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he had a proposal to make, sir?&rdquo;
asked Hugh, guessing as much from the way
in which Surgeon Richter spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He mentioned in his brief note that he
would like me to have some of you boys come
over to the works; that there were a number of
good cots we could have, together with all the
clean sheets and blankets needed to give the
wounded comfortable beds while they were in
our temporary hospital. I sent word back that
I was going to gratefully accept his offer, and
thanked him for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Campertown is getting his eyes
opened,&rdquo; observed Ralph, dryly. &ldquo;Seeing such
terrible things is going to make him think a
whole lot different from what he&rsquo;s been doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope it does,&rdquo; said Hugh, sincerely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;If such a thing comes about,&rdquo; remarked
the surgeon, with a positive ring to his voice,
&ldquo;you Boy Scouts will have had a whole lot
to do with the industrial rebellion. He was
highly pleased with what he heard about your
carryings-on here. The sheriff told me that
when I saw him last. I really think he wants
to have a chance to talk with you, Hugh, and
so if I were you I&rsquo;d be one of those to go over
after these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Dr. Richter, I will,&rdquo; replied
the scout master, who naturally felt a little
thrill of elation when he heard these words of
sincere praise from the lips of one he thought
so highly of as the Red Cross surgeon.
&ldquo;Ralph, will you pick out half a dozen of the
fellows to accompany us, while I hunt up the
padrone? While I&rsquo;ve got that other thing in
my mind I&rsquo;d better put the padrone on his
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hugh; meet you a little later at
this tree. I&rsquo;ll pick out a husky lot, so they can
carry the cots if they happen to be heavy. It
was right decent of old Campertown to make
this offer, I take it. He&rsquo;s seeing a light, all
right; and if things keep on working as they
seem now, better times are coming for these
poor dagoes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Ten minutes later Hugh joined the impatient
group that was waiting for him under the tree
in question. They immediately started toward
the plant, and quickly arrived at the gate.</p>
<p>Here they found a man on guard, who had
evidently received orders to admit any of the
wearers of the khaki who might appear, for he
stepped aside and waved them inside the stockade.</p>
<p>Besides Ralph and Hugh there were Billy
Worth, Tom Sherwood, Jack Dunham, Bud
Morgan, Blake Merton and a boy who went
by the name of &ldquo;Whistling Smith.&rdquo; The last
mentioned had not been in camp at the time
Hugh and his five chums hurried in the direction
of the scene of battle; he and another
scout, Monkey Stallings by name, a fellow
who delighted in doing all sorts of acrobatic
feats, had arrived later in the morning, having
hiked all the way from Oakvale since early
dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>To enter the works they had to pass through
the office. Here they found Mr. Campertown,
and seated on a chair was the merry-faced little
chap, whose smile had already captivated
most of the boys who had seen him. Reuben
Campertown, Hugh had learned, was the only
child of the rich man&rsquo;s dead son, and evidently
the apple of his grandfather&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>The millionaire greeted them with a smile.
Hugh realized that at such a time Mr. Campertown
looked vastly different from what he
had believed him to be before, when that
gloomy and even stern expression had marked
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came, boys,&rdquo; he told them,
and his eyes rested longest on Hugh, as though
he had somehow learned that much of the
credit which the Red Cross surgeon had given
to the scouts for their knowledge of &ldquo;first aid
to the injured&rdquo; was to be credited to their efficient
leader.</p>
<p>Mr. Campertown himself proceeded to show
them where the supplies he had mentioned in
his note to Dr. Richter could be found; and the
cheery-looking little curly-headed chap held
fast to his hand all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take what cots you think you can use,
boys,&rdquo; the owner of the works told them.
&ldquo;Take also this pile of sheets and blankets.
Tell the surgeon I do not expect them back
again. It is as little as I can do to try and
repair some of the mistakes that have occurred
in connection with this unfortunate business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The boys started to carry off the cots needed
first. Hugh had found out that in all they
required four, with the necessary sheets and
blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The padrone will open his eyes when he
sees all this coming in,&rdquo; remarked Billy Worth,
who had loaded himself down with a cot and
some of the other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Mr. Campertown said, turning
to Hugh, and looking a little confused. &ldquo;I
find that my manager laid in enough provisions
for a long siege. Now that things have taken
on a new look, I&rsquo;d like to get rid of some of
this unnecessary food. There&rsquo;s a heap of supplies
you boys can take over to the Red Cross
surgeon with my compliments. He may find
something in the lot he can make use of for
his patients. I hope so, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Hugh felt like giving a hurrah, though he
resisted this impulse and only smiled as he
thanked the other. According to his way of
thinking this wealthy man was having something
of a revolution come about within him.
All his ideas in connection with the abyss that
should exist between an employer and those
who worked for him for wages were in danger
of being transformed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been that pitiful sight of
those wounded men that did it,&rdquo; Hugh was
telling himself; &ldquo;that and the dark looks on
the faces of the men and women in the crowd.
He never dreamed what was going to happen
to him this day when he started out with his
little grandson for a ride in his car. I hope it&rsquo;s
going to be a red letter day for Mr. Campertown,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys could not carry all the cots, supplies
of bedding, and the heap of groceries as
well, they gladly promised to come back for a
second load. Hugh was about to also pack
some of the hams and other things over to
the settlement when Mr. Campertown laid a
detaining hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please stay here with me while your comrades
are gone,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;I want
to ask you some questions about your organization.
Tell me what you have done in the
past? This is not the first time you boys have
managed to stretch out a helping hand to those
who needed assistance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Thrilled by this request, Hugh was only too
happy to obey. He knew he could relate a
number of things connected with Oakvale
Troop of Boy Scouts that would prove interesting
to Mr. Campertown. And all the while
he hoped to be able to work in a few words
that might serve to make the rich man consider
the wisdom of bridging the chasm that
lay between himself and his former employees.</p>
<p>The boys returned and carried away the rest
of the stuff. Still Hugh and Mr. Campertown
sat there in the office and talked. The little
boy had gone to sleep in his grandfather&rsquo;s
arms, with his curly head resting on that protecting
shoulder. Every time the owner of the
plant looked down at his rosy face a tender expression
could be seen on his own usually
stern countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun rises and sets for him in that
child,&rdquo; was what Hugh told himself. He
wondered what it might mean to Mr. Campertown
if anything happened to deprive him of
this one consolation in his declining years,
since the boy&rsquo;s parents were both dead, he had
told Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The scout master in that hour of time had
told the master of the works a great many
things in connection with what he and his
chums had done in times past. His narrative
was extremely modest, and to listen one would
be inclined to think Hugh had no more to do
with these exploits than the lowest scout in the
troop; but Mr. Campertown could read between
the lines.</p>
<p>Hugh was thinking of taking his leave when
the gentleman startled him by asking a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me, Hugh, who
the Red Cross nurse is I noticed assisting Dr.
Richter; the one with the color in her cheeks?
I had just a glimpse of her face, and somehow
it seemed strangely familiar, though I don&rsquo;t
seem able to place it. What is her name, my
son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">HUGH SCENTS A MYSTERY.</span></h2>
<p>When the owner of the plant asked Hugh
that strange question it flashed upon the scout
master that his comrades had noticed the Red
Cross nurse acting in a peculiar fashion at
the time Mr. Campertown sat there in the big
touring car in which the sheriff and some of
his hastily summoned posse had come on the
scene.</p>
<p>Yes, he remembered how Alec, acting as
spokesman for the others, had mentioned the
fact of her seeming to shrink back as though
to avoid being particularly noticed by the millionaire.
She had stared very hard at the little
boy, too, and Alec had, in his impetuous
way, even gone so far as to characterize her
look as a <i>hungry</i> one, as though she could eat
the child.</p>
<p>He knew that Mr. Campertown was looking
at him as he waited to hear his reply; and
so the boy hastened to collect his thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I never saw them before they came
in the ambulance, sir,&rdquo; he commenced to say.
&ldquo;There were two nurses with Dr. Richter, both
of them connected with the Red Cross hospital
in Farmingdale, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand, Hugh; but it was the
younger nurse to whom I was referring,&rdquo; the
other hastened to tell the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is Nurse Jones,&rdquo; Hugh replied;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I know about her, except that she&rsquo;s
got a natural gift along the line of nursing
people. When she comes along they seem to
forget all their troubles in her sunny smile. I
watched this happen more than a few times,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could see that Mr. Campertown looked
disappointed. Evidently something in connection
with Nurse Jones had caused the rich man
to want to know more about her.</p>
<p>Hugh told himself that it was none of his
business, and he had better forget all about it;
but at the same time he was going to find this
a difficult thing to do, especially when his boyish
curiosity was bound to be piqued continually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>After he left Mr. Campertown, Hugh
walked back to the foreign settlement. Here
he found the padrone watching the changes
that were taking place inside that little frame
schoolhouse, under the supervision of the surgeon
and the nurse.</p>
<p>Hugh looked more closely at the latter than
he had up to then allowed himself to do. He
noted that she was an uncommonly fine-looking
young woman, with a healthy color, bright
eyes, and just the cheery expression on her
face that would act like a tonic upon any sufferer
who might chance to fall under her care.</p>
<p>Once Hugh started and held his breath. It
was when the thought struck him that a certain
expression about Nurse Jones&rsquo; face when she
looked sad reminded him of Mr. Campertown
himself! That was a startling idea, and set
the boy&rsquo;s brain to doing all sorts of acrobatic
feats in trying to figure out what it might
mean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; whispered Alec in his ear just
about that time, &ldquo;you should have been here to
watch Nurse Jones when she learned what the
crusty old millionaire owner of the plant had
opened his heart to do. She listened as though
her breath had almost been taken away. Then
I saw such a heavenly smile creep over her
face! Say, it reminded me of that cherub we
used to see in the window of Decker&rsquo;s art store
in Oakland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, you&rsquo;re beginning to get poetical, I&rsquo;m
afraid, Alec,&rdquo; urged Hugh, though the intelligence
had really affected him more or less.
&ldquo;Of course, as a hospital nurse she felt pleased
to see these nice cots and sheets and sweet
blankets coming in, to take the place of that
riff-raff the old padrone supplied. It must
have been a sore trial to a Red Cross nurse to
ever have to handle such stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so, Hugh,&rdquo; added Alec, evidently
still unconvinced; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s my opinion Nurse
Jones was thinking more about the change in
<i>him</i> than anything connected with clean hospital
supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When everything had been attended to the
result was most impressive. Clean, white bedclothing
and blankets, with cots for the patients,
added a thousand per cent. to the attractiveness
of the temporary hospital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the padrone, how his black eyes
glisten,&rdquo; said Ralph Kenyon to Hugh, as they
stood there and surveyed the interior of the
little schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s pleased over the way his people
are being taken care of,&rdquo; the scout master replied.
&ldquo;This is going a great ways toward
checking the bitter feeling of hostility these
hot-blooded foreigners were beginning to show
for Mr. Campertown, their former employer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Billy Worth. &ldquo;If you
asked me now I&rsquo;d say that the padrone&rsquo;s got
that smile that won&rsquo;t come off on his phiz on
account of the fine pile of grub over yonder
that the gentleman sent to the surgeon. Every
time he looks that way I c&rsquo;n see his lips work,
as though they were watering at the thought
of feasts to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Billy,&rdquo; exclaimed Alec Sands, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
hardly fair for you to judge everybody by your
own standard of thinking. We all know your
weakness, and how many a time you&rsquo;ve confessed
to dreaming of big feasts. There goes
Hugh over to talk with the padrone again. I
wonder what he&rsquo;s telling him now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The scout master had considered it a good
time to sow some seed in the mind of the man
whose will swayed the strikers. That was always
present with Hugh. He knew these poor
foreigners would soon be in a pitiful condition
unless they had a chance to take up their former
work again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, padrone,&rdquo; he said to the old man,
as he reached his side, &ldquo;things are looking
brighter already. Mr. Campertown is beginning
to repent having acted as he did. These
wounded people may be the means of starting
up the works again, with all the old employees
at their former wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eet would be goot eef that could be so,&rdquo;
remarked the padrone, with an anxious look
on his face. &ldquo;He do not understand how it
cost so much to lif for us all. He never cut
the wage down eef he know that. I haf think
it all was over when my people they be shot
down like animals; but like you say, young
sig&ntilde;or, it may come to the good turn yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how generously he has acted,&rdquo;
continued Hugh&mdash;&ldquo;sending over not only the
cots and bedding, but food as well. That
shows he is sorry for what happened. If only
you can keep the hotheads among your men
quiet for a little while, padrone, something tells
me it is all going to turn out right for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you eet shall be so,&rdquo; the old man
said solemnly. &ldquo;My word eet ees the law with
my people. They be guided by what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh felt easier in his mind after what he
had said to the padrone. If those three meddling
former guards did attempt to stir
up trouble between the strikers and the sheriff&rsquo;s
posse, he believed the firm hand of the
padrone would be able to check the mischief
in its beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come over to our camp just
before dark,&rdquo; Hugh continued, &ldquo;and take supper
with us all. Have you ever met with any
Boy Scouts over in your country, for they are
to be found all over the world these days, even
in Japan, and out in the Philippines, I understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The padrone was bright enough to grasp
what Hugh meant; but he shook his head in
the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haf not seen any, but my people they
write to me their boys they be scouts and wear
the uniform,&rdquo; the old man replied proudly, as
he even ventured to let his hand fall with a certain
amount of respect on the khaki sleeve of
Hugh&rsquo;s coat, and then turned his eyes curiously
upon the several badges the boy had
been given the right to wear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lots of big changes have taken place
in Italy since you came away, I suppose,&rdquo;
Hugh told him. &ldquo;In Europe boys become
scouts with the idea of serving their country
as soldiers later on. Over here, in America,
we never hold that notion up before our recruits,
because our motto is to help those in
trouble, and avoid all fighting, when we can
do it with credit to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor and Nurse Jones also promised
to join the scouts again at supper time, so
Billy Worth and a corps of assistants hurried
off to start preparations for the evening meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and make the poor old padrone
forget all about his troubles for once,&rdquo; the
good-natured Billy had said when he heard
who was coming. &ldquo;Somehow, I kind of like
that chap; there&rsquo;s a deal of humor in him, once
you get it on tap. And I reckon he hasn&rsquo;t slept
any too sound ever since this trouble came up
between his people and their employer. Yes,
we&rsquo;ll treat him to a good square meal, such as
he hasn&rsquo;t had for many a day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The afternoon was wearing away, and night
would soon be coming along. Hugh found
himself wondering whether darkness would
bring about any change in the relations existing
between the workmen and their former
boss. He was thinking about the suspicious
actions of those three discharged guards when
he fell into this train of speculation.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to leave for the camp
of the scouts, one of the sheriff&rsquo;s posse came
to the emergency hospital with a package, saying
that Mr. Campertown wished Dr. Richter
and Nurse Jones to please accept the trifling
addition to their supplies, as he feared they
would lack some of their customary food while
compelled to remain in the foreign settlement.</p>
<p>When the surgeon, with a smile of appreciation,
opened the package&mdash;the nurse standing
by with a look of wonder on her pink face&mdash;Hugh
saw it contained a number of things that
the head man of the guards must have laid in
for his own entertainment, and was unable to
take away with him: dainties, such as sardines,
canned lobsters, condensed milk, tea, chocolate,
and the like&mdash;and even a box of fine
candy, which the gallant surgeon immediately
placed in the hands of Nurse Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">AROUND THE SCOUTS&rsquo; CAMPFIRE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This makes me think of some of the bully
times we&rsquo;ve had in days gone by,&rdquo; Billy Worth
was saying at the moment Hugh entered the
new camp, &ldquo;and we expected company from
town, and were spreading ourselves to show
folks what fine cooks scouts can be when they
try real hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was indeed considerable bustle in evidence.
Being &ldquo;chief cook and bottle-washer,&rdquo;
for the occasion, as he termed it, Billy had set
a number of the fellows to doing different
tasks. Harold Tremaine and Ned Twyford
sat with their backs against a tree, peeling potatoes;
Tom Sherwood, who often boasted of
his strong eyes, had been delegated to prepare
a big mess of onions, and, though bravely
sticking to the job, despite the smarting, was
already crying over his job.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Others were chopping wood and carrying
the kindlings to where the cook could lay his
hand upon them as needed. As usual, Monkey
Stallings swung head-downward from the limb
of an adjacent tree; those who had given him
such a suggestive nickname certainly knew
what they were about, for the agile boy always
seemed happier carrying on his remarkable
gymnastics than when soberly standing on his
feet.</p>
<p>Taken all in all, it was a bustling picture
upon which the scout master looked as he
stood there smiling. Billy quickly observed his
coming, and called him over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a job for me, Billy?&rdquo; asked
Hugh, as though he meant every word of it,
and would be only too willing to do his part
in the great preparations going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Too many cooks spoil the broth,&rsquo; Mr.
Scout Master,&rdquo; replied Billy. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve
got as many to see after as I can well manage,
as it is. But I did want your valued advice as
to whether we ought to cook a pot of rice, with
all those potatoes and onions the fellows are
preparing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself, Billy. It takes considerable
to fill fourteen mouths, and we expect three for
company besides. If you&rsquo;re meaning to have
several fires going, it would be no harm to put
on a kettle. Boiled rice is always a favorite
of mine, hot or cold, so it isn&rsquo;t apt to go to
waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the same&rsquo;ll go to <i>my waist</i> if the
other grub gives out, you hear me!&rdquo; declared
Bud Morgan, who was giving the finishing
touches to a third cooking fire that Billy had
thought they might need.</p>
<p>So the good work went on, and as the sun
sank out of sight behind the western horizon,
supper was within hailing distance, to judge
from the way some of those always hungry
boys went about sniffing the delightful odors
that filled the air. That is the time when the
minutes drag as if they had leaden weights,
and it seems as though someone must have
surely imitated Joshua of old, and made the
declining sun apparently stand still.</p>
<p>The padrone made his appearance in good
time, and was given a seat of honor on one
of the several logs that had been rolled up in
a circle to serve the diners. His dark face was
a mass of wrinkles now, for he was smiling
all the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Perhaps it might be the padrone felt the
great honor that had been thrust on him when
he was thus invited to eat with the uniformed
scouts. Perhaps he was even thinking of how
he could make boasts when next he wrote a
letter to the old country, and narrated how he
had rubbed elbows with the &ldquo;real thing&rdquo; in
the shape of Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>The chances were, however, that those fine
smells in the air had considerable to do with
the expression of happiness on the padrone&rsquo;s
face. He looked toward the cooking fires frequently,
it might be noticed; and when Bud
Morgan came near dropping one of the big
frying-pans that was heaped with a mess of
potatoes and onions, the padrone was seen to
clasp his hands and look terribly frightened,
as if he feared that after all he might be fated
to lose his anticipated feast.</p>
<p>Then came Dr. Richter and Nurse Jones.
The boys all got up and saluted upon their
arrival. Billy had told them that was the
sort of thing to do when they had a lady come
to dine with them. Nurse Jones laughed quite
merrily as she tried to return their salutation
with a nod of her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Hugh believed she looked prettier than ever
when she did that. He also wondered what
Mr. Campertown would think if he could only
see her now. Would the cobwebs in his confused
brain be swept aside, so that he could
remember who she put him in mind of?</p>
<p>That supper was one none of those who took
part in would soon forget. The boys were
brimful of frolicsome humor, as was usually
the case. They cracked jokes, and made humorous
remarks as they served their guests
and then themselves. This crackling exchange
of badinage was like the sauce for the meal&mdash;it
livened matters, and kept everybody in jolly
spirits.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dr. Richter told them he could not
remember when he had enjoyed a meal as he
had that one. As a doctor connected with a
hospital he may have been used to picking up
his dinners at all hours, and also under some
queer conditions; but it hardly fell to his lot
to sit before a crackling campfire, with a dozen
or more lively scouts in uniform, and tasting
genuine camp fare, cooked by one who prided
himself on having mastered all the wrinkles of
the art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Then again, no doubt, the atmosphere surrounding
them had something to do with their
enjoyment. They were far enough away from
the settlement not to hear the cries of the children
or the barking of the many dogs. Hugh
had made sure that the camp was located
where the prevailing wind would blow <i>toward</i>,
not from the village, which fact was calculated
to make things more pleasant for the campers.</p>
<p>Nurse Jones also seemed to enjoy her dinner
very much. She had to decline ever so many
times when the generous hosts tried to keep
the contents of her pannikin from diminishing
or the coffee in her tin cup from lowering.</p>
<p>China and cut-glass may do all very well
when there is a snowy damask tablecloth and
silver to keep them company; but about the
campfire nothing equals plain honest tinware,
unless it may be the more expensive aluminum
ware, that some campers prefer to take with
them, owing to its many good qualities, such
as extreme lightness in weight, and the fact
that no grease is needed in frying flapjacks for
breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>As before, the doctor continued to ask many
questions connected with scoutcraft. He was
deeply interested in the movement and all that
it stood for. Until recently he had paid little
attention to the activities of such boys whom
he may have been accustomed to seeing, clad
in khaki, on the streets of his native town; but
after making the discovery that these lads
had it in them to accomplish great good in dozens
of ways, he wanted to know all about their
plans and aspirations, as well as their history.</p>
<p>So it came about he heard accounts of many
episodes of the past, such as have been faithfully
related in preceding books of this series.
Each scout took occasion to modestly recount
some incident connected with their many experiences.</p>
<p>Some of them had been with the State Militia
on one of their annual training trips, serving
in the mock battle that had occurred, as a
Signal Corps detachment, and winning high
praise from the general in command because
of their knowledge of the game and the valuable
assistance afforded the army to which they
were attached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>In other fields of scout activities the boys
had played their part with credit to themselves
and the organization to which they belonged.
There had been those among them who had
visited the Florida coast, and assisted the lifesavers
in their work when a wreck was driven
on the reefs during a storm. On another occasion
they had accompanied the Naval Reserve
aboard a war vessel placed at their disposal
by the United States Government; and while
there had picked up a fund of useful information
concerning such means of defense against
a possible foreign enemy.</p>
<p>So they had also gone off with the Government
Geological Survey; and after a fashion
proved themselves worthy helpers to the members
of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s Flying Squadron upon a
certain occasion, when the chance was given
them to see something along such lines.</p>
<p>All these interesting things and many more
were touched upon by those ready talkers, as
they sat there and enjoyed the cheery fire.</p>
<p>Looking around at those bright youthful
faces, the Red Cross surgeon felt that he had
been amply repaid for taking this hurry call
trip out to the scene of the riot, when that
message asking for help had come to them in
Farmingdale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>But for that he would have missed a great
treat, for he might never again have met with
such a splendid opportunity to make the acquaintance
of these sterling fellows, and
while seated at their campfire hear scores of
interesting things connected with the ambitions
and yearnings of a true Boy Scout.</p>
<p>And Nurse Jones also seemed glad she was
there. She had just partaken of her first real
camp dinner, and enjoyed it very much indeed.
Now she was listening to all that was being
said with the deepest interest.</p>
<p>Many times Hugh had noticed a smile on
her face, as though her thoughts were of a
pleasant nature. Then she would suddenly remember
something, for he could see her shut
lips firmly together.</p>
<p>Hugh wondered if her thoughts could be
wandering in the direction of the stern millionaire
who, with his little grandson, expected
to sleep on cots over in the offices of the cement
works.</p>
<p>Whistling Smith was called upon for an exhibition
of his specialty, for he had a remarkable
talent in his line, and could give astonishing
imitations of the warble of every known
species of bird, as well as some imaginary ones
in the bargain. Then he could whistle all the
latest popular songs with variations that always
called out vociferous applause on the
part of the listeners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Monkey Stallings expected that when they
had tired Whistling Smith out they would be
calling on him to perform. He even went so
far as to lay his plan of campaign, and meant
to keep his greatest &ldquo;stunt&rdquo; until the very last,
so that it was apt to leave a pleasant taste in
the mouth; for Monkey was as artful as the
frisky animal after which he had been nicknamed.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that the call for him
to help amuse the invited guests never got beyond
that expectation in the mind of the intended
performer. Something came about that
effectually banished all thoughts of humorous
antics from everybody&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Dr. Richter was perhaps beginning to think
it high time he and the Red Cross nurse were
tearing themselves away from this genial company,
for he was observed to be secretly glancing
at his watch when he thought none of the
boys would be noticing him. Of course, it was
not that he had grown weary of their company,
for that would be next to impossible; but before
long their several patients would be needing
attention, since those left in charge could
not know what to do in case of necessity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>It was just at this time they heard the sound
of coming footfalls. Alec Sands, who possessed
very keen hearing, caught the patter
first, and he leaned over to call the attention
of the scout master to the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody coming, Hugh, and in a bit of a
hurry, too!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Yes, and, unless
I&rsquo;m away off in my guess, there are a pair
of them, in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten seconds later and it was shown that
Alec had been absolutely right in his figuring,
for two forms were seen bearing hastily down
on the campfire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hugh,&rdquo; exclaimed Bud Morgan, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the sheriff, and that&rsquo;s Mr. Campertown along
with him. The old gent looks all broken up
over something, let me tell you. I wonder
what&rsquo;s gone wrong over at the plant now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh noticed that the first thing Mr. Campertown
did was to look eagerly around the
circle, and an expression of bitter disappointment
took the place of the hope that had been
so manifest in his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The sheriff addressed himself directly to
Hugh, and at his first words &ldquo;the cat was out
of the bag,&rdquo; as Alec afterward remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any of you seen the little chap, Reuben
Campertown?&rdquo; asked the sheriff. &ldquo;He
has wandered off, and for the last half hour
we&rsquo;ve found no trace of him. A sudden hope
that he might have come this way brought us
over, but it seems to be blind guess after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">A CALL TO FURTHER DUTY.</span></h2>
<p>If a bomb had been dropped into the camp,
it could hardly have created more of a shock,
so far as Hugh, Dr. Richter, Nurse Jones, Alec
Sands, and perhaps Ralph Kenyon were concerned.</p>
<p>For the first few seconds it seemed to Hugh
that his heart must have stopped still with
dread. He could see that the face of Mr.
Campertown was haggard and drawn. He
had apparently aged ten years in the few hours
since the scout master last saw him. That was
a pretty good index of the way the millionaire
loved and almost worshiped his pretty little
grandson.</p>
<p>Nurse Jones had turned very white, and put
her hand to her throat, as though she felt herself
choking. Hugh, however, forgot her in
the excitement of the moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell us, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo; he
asked, as soon as he could command his voice,
&ldquo;that the boy is lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either strayed away, or else he&rsquo;s been kidnapped
for a purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sheriff said this very sternly he fastened
his accusing eyes on the old padrone.
There could be no mistaking his meaning. He
had dealt many times with some of these foreigners,
and he knew only too well that they
often had strange and un-American ways of
accomplishing their purposes.</p>
<p>Just as Hugh and some of the boys had said
in generally talking things over, carrying people
off and holding them for a ransom has long
been a custom in various lands of Europe.
Evidently the officer believed these angry
strikers, feeling they could not win their case
in the ordinary way, had determined to resort
to such a miserable game as this abduction of
the child would be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The affection felt by Mr. Campertown for
his grandson must have been evident to every
member of that crowd standing by at the time
the sheriff and his posse had stopped for a minute
or two on the way to oust the hired guards.
It would not be unreasonable to suppose that
some of the wilder spirits among the men rendered
furious by a contemplation of their supposed
wrongs, and the presence of those
wounded comrades, should plan to hit back at
the rich man in his only vulnerable spot.</p>
<p>Hugh turned his eyes on the padrone. He
felt a sudden chill in the region of his heart.
Could the wily old man be guilty? Hugh had
somehow come to rather like the padrone who
had such singular power over his people that
he usually could sway them to his way of
thinking.</p>
<p>He felt it was almost impossible that the
old leader should have consented to sit there at
their campfire and partake of their food, if he
were guilty of such a terrible thing.</p>
<p>Hugh immediately felt reassured as soon as
he looked at the other. The swarthy face of
the padrone was drawn, and Hugh thought
there was an expression of injured pride upon
it. His eyes flashed fire, and, as he drew himself
up, he tried to express his feelings in his
crude way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eet ees that you believe some of my people
they haf been take the kid away to hold heem
ofer the head of the gentlemans. You do us
great wrong. We haf not yet been brought to
the point that we make the war on children!
And, eef ees be done, sure I must know of that
same. I gif you my word not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff was watching him with his keen
eye. He had become accustomed to reading
faces long ago, though doubtless some of these
foreign ones were apt to give him more or less
trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard good reports of you, padrone,&rdquo;
he said, slowly. &ldquo;As a rule you have
tried to guide your people along the road that
led to their best interest. Perhaps you had
nothing to do with this ill-advised strike. Let
that pass. There is only one thing that engages
our attention now, and that is the safe
return of the boy. Do you understand what
I am saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, excellency, it is plain to me,&rdquo; replied the
old man, still looking hurt, as though he bitterly
resented the accusation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Campertown will pay five thousand
dollars for the safe return of his grandson,&rdquo;
said the sheriff. &ldquo;It is a shame that such a
thing should happen, and as a rule I am utterly
opposed to this blackmail business; but he insists
on making the offer, and there is nothing
else for us to do but try and compromise a felony.
Five thousand dollars is a big sum, padrone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eet ees a fortune to families that be very
near starving,&rdquo; replied the padrone; &ldquo;but I tell
you that eef you find that any of my people
haf take the child, even eef he be return safe
and unharm, not one dollar shall be claim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, padrone!&rdquo; burst out Bud
Morgan, unable to contain himself any longer.</p>
<p>The sheriff nodded his head, while still
watching the padrone closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the way you say that, padrone,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;It sounds honest. Perhaps this
thing may have been done by some of the hotheads
without your knowledge. They may
have guessed that you would not stand for
such a game. How about that, padrone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do not belief,&rdquo; came the prompt reply.
&ldquo;All I can say ees that when I tell my
people how eet ees, and that a thief haf taken
a child to strike at the heart of Mr. Campertown,
efery one will join me to hunt for eet.
They do not haf much reason to lof Mr. Campertown
this day of sorrow; but there was time
when they take off hats and cheer him when he
come here to works.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty fair offer, I should say!&rdquo; Billy
Worth muttered.</p>
<p>The sheriff turned to Mr. Campertown and
talked with him in low tones. Hugh believed
the millionaire had been much impressed with
the dignified words spoken by the old padrone.
Perhaps they cut him to the quick, and made
him realize that he had not been treating these
employees of his of late as he should. Hugh
hoped deep down in his boyish heart that great
and lasting good was going to spring from all
this trouble.</p>
<p>Presently the sheriff turned again. This
time his eyes were on Hugh, and he beckoned
to the scout master to join him, which the other
did with promptness, scenting something in
the line of action.</p>
<p>It turned out exactly that way, for the first
thing the officer did was to lay a patronizing
hand on Hugh&rsquo;s shoulder and say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Campertown here has requested me to
ask you all to assist in the search for his grandchild.
It seems a strange thing for a sheriff
to rest his confidence in <i>boys</i>, but then I&rsquo;ve
heard considerable about what you lads have
accomplished in the past, and this is a case
where &lsquo;beggars mustn&rsquo;t be choosers.&rsquo; How do
you feel about making a try to earn that splendid
reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked the officer squarely in the eye
as he replied calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You evidently do not know much about the
rules governing Boy Scouts, Mr. Sheriff, or
you wouldn&rsquo;t hold out that reward as an inducement
for us to try and find the poor little
chap. We are not allowed, as a rule, to accept
pay for any service we render, and especially
to those in trouble. All the same I&rsquo;m sure
every fellow around this campfire will be wild
to offer his services in the search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big sheriff was very greatly impressed
with what Hugh said, as his next words
proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds fine, son. I reckon I don&rsquo;t
know enough about the scout movement to
make such an error of judgment as that. In
all my experience this is the first time I ever
heard anyone decline to be rewarded. If
that&rsquo;s the way you scouts do things there&rsquo;s
some hope for this old world yet. But we must
not lose any more time. Padrone, are you
willing to stir up your people, and start a general
alarm for the missing boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go right away, and efery man and
woman they try their level best so to find eet,&rdquo;
replied the padrone, as he saluted the sheriff
and hurried off.</p>
<p>Hugh saw the officer follow his vanishing
form with his eye, and then shake his head.
From this the boy understood that, while much
impressed with the manner of the padrone, he
was not wholly convinced that the strikers were
guiltless.</p>
<p>Mr. Campertown now turned to the scout
master. Evidently he had been deeply interested
in what Hugh had told him concerning
the activities of the Oakvale scouts in times
past. When this terrible necessity burst upon
him so suddenly, and there had arisen so great
a need of assistance, Mr. Campertown must
have suddenly remembered that these lads had
achieved marked success in tracking lost people.
At any rate, this would account for his
appeal through the sheriff for their aid in his
time of need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>He looked very forlorn as he faced Hugh.
The boy thought he had never seen so great a
change in any one in such a short time. Those
who might have considered Mr. Campertown
autocratic and domineering would hardly class
him so if they could have seen how his lips
trembled, and how his hand shook as he laid
it on Hugh&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;do your best
to find Reuben. He is the light of my life, and
it would cut me to the heart if any ill befel
him. The sheriff made a mistake when he
spoke about that reward to you. It applied
only to others. I do not promise <i>you</i> any cash
reward if you succeed; but anything you ask
of me I will grant; for I know that you will
not be unreasonable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a meaning back of those words,
and Hugh knew it. He believed Mr. Campertown
realized the scout master was deeply interested
in the welfare of those people in the
wretched hovels of the foreign settlement; and
it must be that he wanted Hugh to feel that
he stood ready to do the right thing by them
if only this load could be taken from his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir; we&rsquo;ll try the best we know
how to find Reuben. It will be strange if a
dozen and more scouts can&rsquo;t get on track of
him. I give you my promise we will do everything
in our power to succeed; and that&rsquo;s all
I can say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Campertown squeezed his hand convulsively,
cast an appealing look around at the circle
of boyish faces, and then followed the sheriff
off, doubtless returning to the plant in hopes
that some good news had come to light during
their brief absence.</p>
<p>Immediately the scouts clustered around
their leader. They had not heard all that had
passed between Hugh, the sheriff, and the
grief-stricken millionaire, but sufficient had
come to their ears to whet their curiosity, and
questions poured upon the scout master.</p>
<p>Hugh, knowing that the best way to satisfy
his comrades was to tell the whole story as
briefly as he could, commenced to do so. They
listened to him in absolute silence. No one interrupted
because all were so anxious to get
the facts, that they could not think of causing
any unnecessary delay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>As soon as Hugh had finished there was a
perfect flood of suggestions as to what ought
to be done. The scout master, however, knew
that nothing would ever be accomplished unless
they went at things in a systematic way. Accordingly
he told Ralph, Alec and Billy to step
aside so they could figure out a program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t go at this thing blindly,&rdquo; he
said in the beginning, &ldquo;and rush around without
any method. The more haste the less
speed in the end. First of all we ought to try
and figure out who has carried the child off,
or whether he simply strayed away as a little
tot often does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The padrone acted as though he was mighty
sure none of the strikers could have had a
hand in the game, you noticed, Hugh?&rdquo; remarked
Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and somehow I&rsquo;m ready to stake my
belief on the padrone,&rdquo; answered Hugh. &ldquo;He
acts to me as if he had only the good of his
people at heart. If any hotheads, as the sheriff
seemed to think might be the case, have
abducted the child so as to get a ransom, or
make Mr. Campertown come to terms, the padrone
doesn&rsquo;t know of it. But he means to
find that out right away. I could see it in his
eyes as he hurried off. Ralph, what makes you
so uneasy, you&rsquo;ve got something on your
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I have, Hugh,&rdquo; admitted
the other. &ldquo;The fact is, I believe I know who&rsquo;s
stolen little Reuben!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">NURSE JONES MAKES AN APPEAL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! that&rsquo;s talking some, Ralph!&rdquo; exclaimed
Billy. &ldquo;Hit it up, then, and tell us who&rsquo;s the
guilty party. It&rsquo;s going to make our job a
whole lot easier if we know who we&rsquo;re chasing
after right in the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ralph,&rdquo; added Alec, impatiently, &ldquo;put
us on the track, if you know so much. I hope
it isn&rsquo;t the old padrone, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked fixedly at Ralph. He suddenly
remembered a conversation they had not long
before. It flashed through his mind that Ralph
must be referring to the subject of that talk
when he so positively declared he knew who
was guilty of abducting the little boy.</p>
<p>So Hugh simply held up his right hand with
three fingers extended; and when the other
scout saw this he nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Hugh; you take my word for it;
those three ugly guards who came sneaking
back made this grand-stand play. We were off
our base when we thought they just meant to
break into the safe in the plant and get something
that was kept there. They knew a better
way to strike for a big sum; they guessed
Mr. Campertown valued Reuben higher than
anything he might keep locked up in that safe.
What d&rsquo;ye say, am I hewing close to the line
or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me something to think about,
Ralph, I own up,&rdquo; the scout master admitted,
with a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three of them near the works,&rdquo;
Ralph explained to Alec and Billy. &ldquo;I saw the
sly bunch, and dropped in a patch of brush to
watch. They acted suspicious, and when I reported
to Hugh here we had an idea they might
mean to get even for being turned adrift by
breaking in to-night and looting the safe of the
plant. But, say, they had a game up their
sleeve worth ten of that, believe me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy and Alec were visibly impressed with
the force of Ralph&rsquo;s argument. It sounded
reasonable to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the guards went away feeling
sore,&rdquo; ventured Alec, who had a great habit of
arguing to himself in a convincing manner,
&ldquo;because they lost a well-paid job. Besides,
they are known to the sheriff, and stand a
chance of being arrested for willful murder,
in case any of these people should die. Yes,
I guess they would feel pretty desperate, and
the three who came back must have planned
some bold game. Ralph, you&rsquo;re a credit to the
troop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph was waiting to hear what Hugh
would have to say. Others might &ldquo;render their
tribute due to C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; but until the scout master
approved, Ralph would not feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Hugh had meanwhile revolved the idea in
his active mind. He saw it looked not only
possible but probable that Ralph had hit on
the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they have taken the boy, as you
think, Ralph,&rdquo; he now said, &ldquo;their motive is not
bound to be just what you hint. They may not
mean to hold him for ransom; that is a pretty
risky thing to do, and the punishment for kidnapping
a child is pretty severe, you remember,
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what else could they mean to do,
Hugh?&rdquo; asked Ralph, puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;If they could make it look as if some of the
strikers had stolen the boy,&rdquo; continued the
scout master, &ldquo;Mr. Campertown would be
sorry he had discharged those guards. It may
be they intend to suddenly come rushing in
with the child, and claim they rescued him
from a bunch of the foreigners, after a warm
fight, showing a few slashes in their clothes as
evidence of how desperately they battled to
take the boy away from the rascals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! that would be a smart trick, now,
I should say!&rdquo; remarked Alec; &ldquo;but no matter
what their game may be, it&rsquo;s up to us to get a
move on and find the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do that we&rsquo;ve got to go over to the plant
first of all, and learn just where the boy was
seen last,&rdquo; Hugh told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we strike footprints,&rdquo; said Ralph
positively, &ldquo;leave it to us to keep on the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a good dog along with us,&rdquo;
ventured Billy; but he was immediately
frowned upon by Ralph and Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scouts who know their business have no
need of hounds that I can see,&rdquo; the former
told him. &ldquo;Show me plain signs, and I&rsquo;ll take
you to the end of the trail or know the reason
why.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s stand around here any
longer, anyway,&rdquo; Billy returned to say, unable
to take up the plain dare there seemed to be in
Ralph&rsquo;s last remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we all go along, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a couple ought to stay here in the
camp to look after things while the rest are
away,&rdquo; replied the scout master, and then, after
glancing around at the eager faces of his
comrades he continued: &ldquo;Harold and Monkey
Stallings can be the camp guards. I&rsquo;ve
heard both of them complain of their feet
hurting lately, and there may be heaps of walking
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair indicated looked very much disappointed;
still they were too well drilled to raise
any objection to the decree. Hugh was their
leader, and when he gave an order their duty
was only to obey without questioning the motive
or the justness of his decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>That is one of the things scouts learn&mdash;obedience
to orders. It is a splendid foundation
for their future guidance in life. If they
could point to this as the only achievement of
scoutcraft there would be a good excuse for
the perpetuation of the organization on the
ground of having improved boy character; but
of course there are dozens of other reasons to
show that this movement is the grandest thing
that has ever been known in connection with
the rising generation.</p>
<p>Hugh was now ready to lead his comrades
on to the cement works, in hopes of picking up
a clue that would put them on the track. It
was fated, however, that there should be further
delay, and connected with it another surprise
calculated to give them something of a
shock.</p>
<p>As the scout master turned around he was
made aware of the fact that Nurse Jones had
not taken her departure at the time the sheriff
and Mr. Campertown hastened away. Although
he had not paid any attention to her up
to now, she had apparently hovered close by
the boys, listening to all that was said, and
showing the most intense interest in what
went on.</p>
<p>When Hugh happened to discover her, just
after laying his plans with the three chums
who had been at his elbow, Nurse Jones made
straight toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will let me go with you when
you start off on this hunt for the lost child,
Mr. Scout Master?&rdquo; she said, earnestly.</p>
<p>The boys exchanged looks. It was a novel
request, and Hugh hardly knew how to answer
her. Nurse Jones meant well, but then a
woman was hardly fitted for enduring the fatigue
they might have to encounter when chasing
all around the country in search of the daring
abductors of little Reuben.</p>
<p>Nurses were all right in their places, but it
hardly seemed as though one of them should
want to keep company with scouts when they
were on dangerous duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to refuse you, Nurse Jones,&rdquo; Hugh
finally said, &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t know just where we
will have to go. The distance may be too far
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a famous walker, you remember.
I&rsquo;ve made it a practice to cover ten miles every
day, and often twice that,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Alec snickered at that, for he could see that
none of the scouts had anything on Nurse
Jones when it came to endurance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued Hugh, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s likely
to be danger, because if desperate men have
kidnapped Reuben, they will hardly give him
up without trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is only another argument in favor of
my going with you,&rdquo; the nurse told him. &ldquo;In
our profession we understand we are bound to
incur some peril; and, if there should be fighting
of any kind a nurse would be in her element
binding up the wounds that followed.
You must let me go with you, Hugh. Indeed,
I will not be refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boys could see that Hugh was
&ldquo;taking water,&rdquo; as some of them called it; that
is, his resolution seemed shaken. While he
still objected, he did not appear very firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you want to tag along,
Nurse Jones, when all the rest of us are boys
used to taking hard knocks? You&rsquo;ve got some
reason for doing this; don&rsquo;t you think you
ought to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Alec could be heard saying, half
under his breath, for he understood what it
was Hugh must be figuring on.</p>
<p>The nurse stood there, as if half hesitating.
Then, as though suddenly making up her mind,
she turned again to Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is only fair that I should be taking
you all into my confidence, for, after you hear
what I have to say, I feel sure none of you
can deny me the right to join in the search for
my own little cousin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec acted as though ready to drop to the
ground with astonishment. While he and
Hugh had decided that there was something
peculiar about the actions of Nurse Jones, and
that she looked on Mr. Campertown and his
grandson as anything but strangers, they had
really never gone so far as to figure that there
was actual relationship existing between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Red Cross nurse continued
hastily, as though now that she had lifted the
veil of secrecy she wanted it over with as soon
as possible, &ldquo;I am his grandchild, just as truly
as little Reuben, although he has really never
set eyes on me before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your name isn&rsquo;t Jones?&rdquo; asked Hugh,
though he hardly knew why he should have
made the remark, except that he felt compelled
to say something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is Campertown, but when I took up
the profession of trained nurse, for reasons of
my own I chose to be known as Maude Jones.
My father was the oldest son of Mr. Campertown.
It was the same old story of his marrying
a girl his father did not approve of, so
he was cut off, and has never seen his father
from that day to this&mdash;over twenty-three years
ago. My father is still alive, though in poor
health. He lives in modest rooms in Boston,
and part of my pay goes to his support. Now,
you know my secret, and surely you will not
deny my right to be with you in the search
for my own little cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you came out here in the ambulance
did you know that the plant where the strike
was going on belonged to Mr. Campertown?&rdquo;
asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned it while on the way,&rdquo; she answered,
readily enough, &ldquo;from Dr. Richter,
who had been told about the facts; but it was
too late for me to turn back, even if I had
wanted to. To tell you the truth I did not
think of doing so. A sudden curiosity had
possessed me to see with my own eyes what
my stern grandfather looked like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you have never seen him
even once?&rdquo; asked Alec, amazed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father is very proud, even though
poor,&rdquo; she told him, with a dignity that impressed
the boys. &ldquo;He has always said that
he had done nothing wrong, and would never
beg his father to forgive him. If there ever
was to be any reconciliation it must come from
the other side. And so I was forbidden to ever
try and appeal to Reuben Campertown. I
mean to continue to obey his wishes, though I
hope something may happen to change things.
It is a terrible thing to have family quarrels;
and really he didn&rsquo;t look so <i>very</i> terrible just
now when he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering the look of woe on the face
of the millionaire, Hugh felt that she was putting
it very mildly when she said this. Oppressed
with a sense of dread concerning the
fate of the child he loved so passionately, Mr.
Campertown had really looked like a man who
would not have harmed a fly if he could help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, am I to accompany you boys, Mr.
Scout Master?&rdquo; asked Nurse Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve proved your right to go
along with us,&rdquo; Hugh told her; and every fellow
nodded in vigorous assent when he said
this, for they liked Nurse Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">SURPRISING THE SHERIFF.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it, then,&rdquo; Hugh told them all,
&ldquo;so let&rsquo;s be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just give us a minute, please, Hugh,&rdquo; interposed
Alec. &ldquo;I want to carry along a fine
club I&rsquo;ve got in the tent here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if Monkey Stallings will lend me that
electric torch he brought with him I might find
a chance to make good use of the same,&rdquo; observed
Ralph who, being the best trailer in the
whole troop, anticipated that much would be
expected of him in the present crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will, Ralph,&rdquo; replied Monkey Stallings.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a brand new battery in the
torch, too, so it ought to last you a good while.
I&rsquo;ll get it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>A few of the other fellows were also bustling
around. Perhaps they thought it best to arm
and equip themselves with staves or cudgels
as a means of defense, should they come in
contact with the three desperate guards.
Scouts may be debarred from handling firearms
as a general practice, but occasions are
apt to arise where they are compelled to defend
themselves; and at such times a club is
a pretty good thing to have in hand.</p>
<p>This took but a few minutes. Hugh was getting
impatient to be off, for he considered that
they had already wasted enough time. The
trail would be getting colder all the while; and
besides, they would still have to pick up some
points over at the plant.</p>
<p>Finally they were all ready, and a glance at
their eager faces spoke volumes for the willing
spirit with which those scouts entered into this
game of trying to recover the lost boy.</p>
<p>Harold Tremaine and Monkey Stallings,
with rueful looks, saw their comrades depart.
They were undoubtedly keenly disappointed.
Smothering this feeling as best they could they
called out after the party:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s wishing you and Nurse Jones the
best of luck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>She waved her hand back at them. It must
have pleased her to know that these happy-go-lucky
scouts had already become quite fond of
her in the short time they were favored with
her acquaintance. Friends were not so plentiful
in her sad experience that she could afford
to despise the honest interest these lads were
taking in her fortunes.</p>
<p>Hugh remembered that he had made out the
time as about nine o&rsquo;clock just before the unexpected
coming of the sheriff and Mr. Campertown
with their startling news.</p>
<p>Not that the scout master carried a watch
with him, or had even asked one of the others
to inform him as to the time. A scout&rsquo;s clock
is usually in the heavens. If he has learned
his lesson properly he is able to tell pretty accurately,
in case the sky is clear, what hour of
the day or night it may chance to be.</p>
<p>This is only done by making himself familiar
with the positions of the various heavenly bodies,
the sun by day, the moon and planets by
night. In time he knows just by taking a rapid
survey of the blue vault above him how the
night goes, for he has become aware that this
star or that one will be in a certain position,
behind the western horizon at twelve, one, two
or three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>If the disappearance of the little fellow was
discovered about dark, as they had been given
to understand, that would mean an hour or
more had since elapsed.</p>
<p>Hugh went even further and figured that
the abductors would hardly try to do their
work until the shades of evening had commenced
to gather, so they might slip away
without being detected.</p>
<p>The boys were already at the works now,
having skirted the settlement on the way, and
noticed that there was renewed excitement as
the padrone started the inmates to scouring
the immediate vicinity in search of traces of
the missing child. Hugh could see that the
women who wore those bright-colored handkerchiefs
about their heads seemed to be most
in evidence, nor did he wonder at this; since
they had children of their own, ragged and
dirty-faced, but nevertheless precious to them,
and they could therefore feel for the stricken
millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve forgotten just now all they suffered
at his hands, I do believe,&rdquo; Nurse Jones
was saying in the ear of the scout master, for
she persisted in tripping along close to Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so,&rdquo; the boy replied; &ldquo;and I hope
Mr. Campertown will not forget the fact,
either. If we have the good luck to fetch Reuben
back, I&rsquo;m going to hold him to the promise
he made us; and I know what it is I mean to
ask him to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can give a good guess, Hugh,&rdquo;
Nurse Jones murmured. &ldquo;I wish to say that
the thought does you credit. I only hope and
pray we may find the child, and that he can be
taken back unharmed. I believe it will be a
turning point in the life of that stern old man.
It&rsquo;s a lesson he&rsquo;s been in need of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that they had reached the stockade
around the cement works, they found, as upon
the occasion of their other visit, that some of
the sheriff&rsquo;s posse stood on guard.</p>
<p>Apparently they had received their orders
not to debar any of the scouts from entering
as they pleased, for when Hugh started to pass
through the gate there was no remonstrance
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye reckon Hugh means to do here,
Billy?&rdquo; whispered Whistling Smith, as with
all the others he passed inside the building that
had been without workers for so long a time
now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s where the little chap was when
last seen,&rdquo; explained Billy; &ldquo;and to get on his
track we&rsquo;ve had to come here. If we only had
a dog now, one of the right kind that&rsquo;s accustomed
to following a scent, a hound like they
use to hunt escaped convicts from the turpentine
camps down South, all we would have to
do would be to let the dog sniff at some article
of clothing worn by the kid. After that he&rsquo;d
pick out the trail, just by his sense of smell,
and lead us straight to the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ralph is a crackerjack of a trailer, you
remember, Billy,&rdquo; said Whistling Smith; &ldquo;and
he&rsquo;s bound to do his level best this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I reckon Ralph is as good a hand as
any ordinary scout can be,&rdquo; Billy admitted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading lots lately about what wonderful
things those smart tracking hounds
have been known to do; and, say, I&rsquo;d just like
to see some of it with my own eyes. But then
we&rsquo;ll stand back of Ralph, and help out all we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Considering that Billy was not known to be
much of a hand at reading signs and following
a trail through brush and over hills this was
very condescending on his part. No doubt
Ralph would have felt greatly encouraged
could he have heard the noble resolve.</p>
<p>Ralph at that moment was busily engaged.
With Hugh he had sought the offices of the
plant, thinking that the sheriff might be found
there, if he were still about the buildings. It
proved to be a good guess, for they did discover
both the sheriff and Mr. Campertown,
the latter looking more dejected than ever,
which was ample proof that thus far no signs
had been found of the strangely missing child.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the two scouts, Mr.
Campertown started and looked eagerly toward
them as though a sudden wild hope had seized
upon him. When he saw who the newcomers
were, and realized that they could not have any
glad tidings for him as yet, he heaved a great
sigh and sank back again in his chair.</p>
<p>Perhaps he and the sheriff may have been
consulting on some plan. If so, they immediately
put it out of their heads at the coming
of Hugh and Ralph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to begin on the job now,
boys?&rdquo; asked the officer kindly, yet with a
touch of half-veiled sarcasm in his voice, as
though, after all, he had grave doubts as to
the lads being able to undertake the successful
carrying out of such a task as now lay before
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to ask a few questions first, sir,
and then make our start from here,&rdquo; the scout
master informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like business, anyway,&rdquo; the
sheriff observed, &ldquo;and I suppose it is about the
boy last being seen you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, yes,&rdquo; Hugh told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and give you the few facts we&rsquo;ve
dug out so far,&rdquo; said the big official. &ldquo;I have
two of my men who used to be on the police
force in Boston working on the case. You&rsquo;ll
have to take care, or they&rsquo;ll cut the ground out
from under the feet of the scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference to us if
they did,&rdquo; said the scout master; &ldquo;our only
idea is to find the child, and so long as that&rsquo;s
done, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who has the luck to
bring him back. Please tell us what you&rsquo;ve
found out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;The little fellow ate his supper with his
grandfather at half past six. In fact, the three
of us sat at that table over there, and tried to
make the best of the meal they prepared for
us here in the plant. It&rsquo;s been the habit of
little Reuben to be put to bed early, and so Mr.
Campertown took him off immediately we were
done. Why, the kid was that sleepy he went
off while we sat here at the table, and the last
I saw of him he was lying like a log in his
grandfather&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Campertown barely suppressed a groan.
The recollection evidently came near overpowering
him, so that it was only with an effort
he shut his jaws tightly and held his feelings
in with a tight rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour or so afterward, about eight it
was, and just dark,&rdquo; continued the sheriff,
&ldquo;Mr. Campertown had occasion to go again to
the room over yonder, where you see that partly
open door. There had been a couple of cots
arranged for himself and the child, the rest of
us meaning to bunk in other parts of the plant.
Well, I heard him give a cry, and he came
staggering out, looking as white as a ghost, and
trying to tell me that the boy was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! that <i>was</i> exciting,&rdquo; Ralph could not
help saying when the sheriff paused to catch
his breath, for he was a large man, and talking
was not his strongest point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I hurried in,&rdquo; the official went on,
&ldquo;and found a window wide open, showing
where the abductor had entered. We had
heard no sound while we sat here, which
proved that the man or men had worked with
expedition and great caution, not even arousing
the child. That&rsquo;s about the extent of our
information, son. Whoever the contemptible
scoundrel was, he left no card behind him with
his signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened between seven and eight, then,
according to what you say, Mr. Sheriff?&rdquo; Hugh
ventured to say, as though that fact might be
worth remembering later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a certainty, son. The main thing,
though, is the fact that they took the kid out
through the window without my men being
any the wiser. Then there was the stockade
to consider; they must have known where a
weak place could be found in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were on guard here for days and
weeks they would be apt to know every foot
of the place, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; asked Hugh
boldly, so that the sheriff stared at him, and
then exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does this stand for? Have you
lighted on a clue already that my men missed?
Why do you speak of those guards we sent
packing? What have they got to do with this
kidnapping game, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that my chum Ralph, here, saw three
of them sneaking around in the brush outside
the picket lines in the afternoon,&rdquo; Hugh informed
the astonished officer. &ldquo;He watched
them a while, and from their actions felt that
they were up to some mischief. We talked it
over, and wondered if they had designs on the
safe here; but, since you and your strong posse
were on duty, we concluded that it was none
of our business, and that we wouldn&rsquo;t be
thanked if we tried to give you a tip; so we
kept still. But, after we learned that a treasure
many times more valuable than any in the
safe had been stolen, we saw a great light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the sheriff, still staring at Hugh,
slapped his hand down on his thigh, and was
heard to mutter, as if to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! It begins to strike me there
may be something after all to that talk about
the clever way these scouts do their work. I&rsquo;m
getting my eyes opened!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Could we look into the room where the boy
was asleep at the time he was stolen?&rdquo; asked
Hugh; and the sheriff at once manifested a
desire to lead the way, Mr. Campertown following
after them slowly, as though it pained
him to see the empty cot upon which little Reuben
had been left lying.</p>
<p>It was not much of a room, after all, and had
only one window. The boys did not bother
asking what it had been originally used for in
connection with the offices of the big works;
that was a matter that apparently had no connection
with the present.</p>
<p>Just as the sheriff had told them, two cots
were in evidence. One of these was still undisturbed,
and had evidently been intended for
the use of the millionaire when he chose to
retire, after concluding to remain on his property
for a night, now that the authorities had
taken charge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the cot where the boy lay,&rdquo; the
sheriff told them, at the same time pointing to
the second bed, where the sheet and blanket
had been thrown aside, and it could be seen
that a small head had pressed on the pillow.</p>
<p>Hugh and Ralph just glanced around them,
and then turned their gaze on the one window
the room could boast. It was open, as they
had already been advised. After securing possession
of the child, the unknown kidnappers
had not thought it worth while to try and hide
the route by which they had entered and left
the room.</p>
<p>Ralph stepped over at once to that window.
Leaning across the sill, he undoubtedly must
have pressed the button of the hand electric
torch he had borrowed from a brother scout,
for a little glow could be seen without.</p>
<p>Hugh knew what this meant. The tracker
of animals was looking for signs of the invaders.
If the ground beneath the window
happened to be in any way soft, they must have
left some sort of trail behind them that would
give a clue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Ralph turned his head so that he could speak
to the scout master. He seemed to understand
that Hugh would be hovering close behind him,
anxious to hear his opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are marks below, Hugh; and we
can climb out here much easier than bothering
to go around,&rdquo; was what Ralph said eagerly,
for he was like a hound being held in the leash
when scenting the game, and those marks beyond
the window seemed to be beckoning to
him to come on and investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Hugh, promptly, &ldquo;tumble
out, and I&rsquo;ll be with you in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not waiting for further permission, Ralph
made his way through the opening. To an
agile scout it was merely next to nothing, for
the ground lay only a few feet below the window.</p>
<p>Hugh followed after him, to hear a quick
warning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t drop just there, Hugh; you&rsquo;ll
spoil the best of the tracks. Reach around and
get your foot on this board; now swing around,
and there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>No sooner had the scout master effected a
landing than the two boys were bending over,
with the shaft of white light from the hand
torch illuminating the earth directly under the
window. From the opening above them two
heads were thrust&mdash;those of the deeply interested
sheriff and the anxious millionaire, who
were watching to ascertain what was about to
happen.</p>
<p>Ralph was pointing to certain marks, and
calling the attention of his comrade to the fact
that they differed from others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that footprint with the square
toe, Hugh; that&rsquo;s one man&rsquo;s trademark. Now,
here&rsquo;s a second that&rsquo;s entirely different; this
fellow wears a pointed shoe, you see, and is
more of a dude than the first. Now, if I could
only find&mdash;well, talk about luck, will you&mdash;look
at this! A third footprint, and as different
from both the other as black is from
white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; assented the pleased
scout master, &ldquo;that man is wearing old shoes,
and one of them seems to have a torn sole, for
it makes a queer mark every time he puts a
foot down. See here, and here, you can notice
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, all told,&rdquo; said Ralph, with
thrilling emphasis. &ldquo;Hugh, doesn&rsquo;t that just
seem to fit in with my theory to a dot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;There were that many of the ugly guards
came back, for a fact,&rdquo; admitted Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve settled that part of it without a question,&rdquo;
said the other boy firmly; &ldquo;and now the
things we&rsquo;ve still got to figure out are, what
object these desperate men had in view when
they stole the boy; and how can we find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, son!&rdquo; chuckled the interested
sheriff, leaning from the open window.
&ldquo;I want to say that this is worth all the trip
out here to learn. My two men never bothered
looking for tracks; they asked some questions,
and then went hurrying off, saying they believed
they knew where the dagoes had taken
the boy. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they&rsquo;re
wasting their time over at the settlement rummaging
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the boys took much notice of this
praise from the sheriff. The fact of the matter
was they were too deeply engrossed in the
carrying out of their plan of campaign to
bother with side issues. After it was all over,
no doubt, they might feel highly gratified to
hear such expressions of appreciation from an
officer of the law.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll step around and fetch the rest of the
boys,&rdquo; suggested Hugh, &ldquo;while you&rsquo;re making
a start along the trail, Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you would, Hugh,&rdquo; muttered the
other, already moving off, and bending low,
as he followed the tracks with his practised
eye.</p>
<p>So the scout master speedily appeared in the
midst of the other members of the troop, who,
with Nurse Jones, had been impatiently waiting
just outside the office. Of course all of
them were rather surprised when Hugh spoke,
for they had believed him inside the building
all this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found the trail,&rdquo; he told them
quickly, and thinking it best that every one
should know the facts without delay, Hugh
went on to add: &ldquo;There were three of the
abductors, just the same number of guards
Ralph saw hiding in the brush and watching
the plant this afternoon. Come along with me,
all of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; Bud Morgan was heard
to mutter.</p>
<p>Trooping at the heels of their leader they
quickly rounded the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that moving along over there?&rdquo;
asked Whistling Smith, who had suddenly discovered
a strange sort of glow apparently
creeping close to the ground within the stockade,
and looking very uncanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know? That&rsquo;s our chum,
Ralph, and he&rsquo;s using that bully little hand
torch Monkey Stallings loaned him,&rdquo; Billy
Worth hastened to inform the other.</p>
<p>They soon came up with Ralph, who had
stopped close to the stockade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where they got in and out, Hugh,&rdquo;
the tracker was saying, as he pointed to where
there was a gap in the barricade, a heavy plank
having been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As like as not those rascals arranged all
this before they left the place,&rdquo; observed Hugh,
as he saw the missing plank lying on the ground
close by. &ldquo;They figured that they&rsquo;d want to
come back for <i>something</i>, and this board was
left hanging loosely so that, while it looked all
right, it could be removed with half an effort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>There was nothing strange about the way
the scout master figured this out. His training
had sharpened his wits and enabled him
to solve what might have been a bit of a mystery
to some boys. But then it is part of a
scout&rsquo;s business to use reason and judgment,
and this was what both Hugh and Ralph were
doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks more and more as if my guess had
hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye right in the center,&rdquo; Ralph
was saying, half to himself, in a satisfied way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the three men, you mean of course,
Ralph,&rdquo; Hugh remarked. &ldquo;Yes, none of us
will ever look at it any other way now. Crawl
through, and we&rsquo;ll follow you. This is the
first stage of the tracking game; if the rest
pans out as well, I can see victory in the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such confident words did much to inspire
all of them with renewed vigor. Looking
around after they had passed beyond the
stockade, the boys could see little save the
gloom of the night; but the faith they felt in
their leaders did much to make this seem less
appalling.</p>
<p>In several places, though, some of them began
to notice moving lights that looked like
jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns in a graveyard or a marsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye make them out to be, Alec?&rdquo;
asked Blake Merton of the scout who happened
to be next to him at the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they were
some of the strikers hunting all around to see
if they can find the lost boy,&rdquo; Alec replied.
&ldquo;Then again it may be that several of the sheriff&rsquo;s
posse, learning about that fat reward Mr.
Campertown has offered for the safe return
of little Reuben, and no questions asked, have
organized a searching party. Five thousand
dollars will spur most men to doing stunts, let
me tell you, Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say, yes!&rdquo; declared the other, with
a sigh, as though he could picture quite a few
glorious things that might come his way should
a kind fortune allow him to win that prize,
which, however, was too good to be true.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ralph, with Hugh close beside
him, was in the van, carefully following the
trail. It seemed a most fortunate thing that
when the abductors of the child made off, bearing
their sleeping burden with them, they
avoided the customary path made by the men
in coming to and going from work.</p>
<p>This fear of meeting someone caused the
three men to pass over fallow ground where
their footprints were apt to be more readily
seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>As the cluster of scouts followed as close
as they thought expedient, they were watching
every motion of the leaders, expressing
their appreciation among themselves in whispered
comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess after all, Billy, you&rsquo;ll admit right
now our chum Ralph is as good at the business
as any trail dog you could scare up!&rdquo; Alec
told the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think, too,&rdquo; added Bud Morgan,
with emphasis. &ldquo;Just see how he keeps
that eagle eye of his glued on the ground; and
notice that we&rsquo;re moving forward right fast
in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph Kenyon is all to the good!&rdquo; said another
enthusiastic scout.</p>
<p>Of course, under all this heavy fire, Billy
felt that he&rsquo;d better throw up his hands and
surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use talking, fellows,&rdquo; he told them,
&ldquo;seems like we&rsquo;d have mighty little use for one
of those hounds as long as we&rsquo;ve got Ralph
to pin to. He&rsquo;s learned his lesson to a dot.
Unless we meet with a setback, it&rsquo;s going to
be all up with that crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;A bunch of scouts like ours ought to be
able to handle three men, I should say,&rdquo; ventured
Tom Sherwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially when they&rsquo;re likely to be cowards
at heart!&rdquo; added Jack Dunham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; demanded
Whistling Smith. &ldquo;Seems to me Ralph said
they looked like a tough lot of fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; the other went on to say
defiantly, as though he knew he was right,
and meant to stick to his assertion, &ldquo;any set of
men who would steal away an innocent little
chap like that Reuben, must be cowards at
heart, no matter how much they try to bluster
and make out to be bullies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Jack,&rdquo; Alec Sands put in. &ldquo;I
back you up in saying that. When it comes
to a show-down, you mark me they&rsquo;ll run before
they think of trying to stand before our
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The idea rather pleased most of the scouts.
They were not inclined to be ferocious at all,
though perhaps some of them would feel disappointed
unless they had a chance to get at
least one whack at the scoundrels who had
stolen the boy. This could be understood from
the nervous manner in which they handled
those various cudgels with which they had
armed themselves before quitting the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE VALUE OF BEING PREPARED.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to find out who&rsquo;s swinging
that lantern anyway,&rdquo; ventured one of the boys
after a while. &ldquo;Ralph&rsquo;s heading in that direction
in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole pack of &rsquo;em in the bargain,
at least four or five, because I c&rsquo;n glimpse
&rsquo;em every time the light swings back,&rdquo; said
Jack Dunham, a bit nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the chatter, will you?&rdquo; observed
Alec. &ldquo;That tells who they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the strikers, for a cookey!&rdquo; added
another boy.</p>
<p>There was a rush as the five men came up to
them. Evidently the sight of that odd glow
traveling over the ground had surprised and
mystified them, and they were now bent on
learning its origin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Ralph at the proper time turned the little
hand searchlight full upon the newcomers.
It was in this way discovered that they were
undoubtedly strikers who had evidently been
scouring the immediate vicinity in the hope of
learning what had become of Mr. Campertown&rsquo;s
grandchild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the old padrone at their head!&rdquo;
ejaculated Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if Hugh means to tell them to fall
in with us?&rdquo; suggested Arthur Cameron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness, I hope not!&rdquo; muttered
Billy Worth, who for some reason of his own
seemed to prefer that the strikers keep their
distance, and to leeward at that. The padrone
had by this time discovered who it was influenced
that queer light to skim along so close
to the ground. Hugh, on his part, was pleased
to see that the old fellow had been doing
everything in his power to fulfill his contract
with regard to trying to find the missing child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop, Ralph,&rdquo; he told the tracker hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shunt them off on a side trail, Hugh!&rdquo;
whispered the anxious Billy. &ldquo;We ought to be
crowd enough ourselves to do the business if
ever we come up with those three.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Hugh managed to do this without hurting
the feelings of the padrone. It only required
a little tact to accomplish the thing. He suggested
that the strikers could cover the ground
in one district while the scouts carried out
their own plans. The padrone understood,
because he and his men drifted off again on
the hunt, for they spread out like an open fan
as they went.</p>
<p>Billy chuckled as though he felt relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for that!&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I
can breathe easy again. Not but that the padrone
means honest, and his men seem to be
all right; but their ways ain&rsquo;t our ways, you
know; and, well, I won&rsquo;t say any more because
I want to be fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened now, I wonder?&rdquo; asked
Whistling Smith, when they saw that the two
in the van had come to a sudden pause.</p>
<p>Hugh turned to the rest of the eager party
hovering around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph says that right here he can see where
the man who had been carrying the child
turned and gave his burden into the charge
of the fellow wearing the torn shoe&rdquo; was what
he told them, much to their wonder and delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going some,&rdquo; said the admiring
Alec. &ldquo;Think of him being able to read signs
just as easy as we might a page in a book. If
any Indian, or that old hunter in Cooper&rsquo;s
Leatherstocking tales, could beat our chum,
I&rsquo;ll eat my hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the forward movement was resumed
they were all feeling more satisfied than ever
that it would come out right. Difficulties
might, and doubtless would, continue to arise
and confront them, but so long as they had
such a clever comrade glued to the trail, these
must in turn be brushed aside.</p>
<p>Yes, the scent of victory seemed to be in the
air for those scouts; it invigorated them beyond
measure, and made the labor of that
night tramp seem like play.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour afterward and Ralph
announced that the third member of the fugitives
had taken the boy, still asleep, and perhaps
drugged so that he might not betray them
by any crying spell brought about by fright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;That eases my mind a whole lot,&rdquo; Bud
Morgan remarked; &ldquo;because do you know I
was afraid that fellow, with that torn sole on
his shoe, might trip and hurt Reuben. But he
didn&rsquo;t, or else Ralph would have told us so.
It&rsquo;s all right, and things are working for us
to beat the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, it was an object lesson to some of
the scouts to see how cleverly Ralph managed
to read those signs. Those, who up to then
had not taken a great deal of interest in such
things, began to realize that they were missing
one of the best traditions of scoutcraft;
and no doubt were taking mental resolutions
that from that time on they would turn over
new leaves.</p>
<p>They had by now gone more than a mile
from the cement plant, and still the trail beckoned
them on. Hugh had given it as his opinion
that the three abductors must certainly be
heading for some place previously selected as
a hide-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I base that belief on several things,&rdquo; he
explained, when they had halted for Ralph to
rest his strained eyes a minute or two. &ldquo;In
the first place they&rsquo;ve been hitting it up in an
almost direct line. If they had been simply
bent on putting as much ground as they could
between themselves and the sheriff&rsquo;s posse,
they would have been apt to turn to the right
or to the left from time to time as if uncertain
which way to go. Am I right, Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds good to me, Hugh,&rdquo; came the
ready response to his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; continued the scout master,
always willing to pass around any knowledge
he might possess, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t likely these desperate
men would go into a game like this
without laying all their plans beforehand.
They take a lot of risk as it is, because kidnapping
a child is a felony that calls for twenty
years in the penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph, being rested, evinced a desire to once
more take up his onerous duties, and so the
little heart-to-heart talk ended for the time being.
Such things as these, however, were apt to
arouse an additional interest in the minds of
lagging scouts, and cause them to watch
Ralph&rsquo;s movements with more concern than
ever.</p>
<p>That first mile began to lengthen until some
of them felt it must surely be double that distance
they had passed over. Still not one complaint
had been uttered or a sigh heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Nurse Jones seemed to be able to hold her
own with the best of them. Apparently it had
been no idle boast on her part when she told
Hugh she made it a practice to walk ten miles
every day and frequently double that far. At
that rate, there was really more danger of
some of the boys dropping out than of Nurse
Jones failing in her self-imposed task.</p>
<p>More than once some of the scouts secretly
told each other that she was a &ldquo;wonder,&rdquo; and
this might be reckoned high praise, coming
from boys who, proud of their own accomplishments
along the line of extended hikes,
were apt to look down contemptuously on such
feeble efforts as their sisters among the Campfire
Girls might attempt.</p>
<p>It had been remarked that not once had
they approached a human habitation. From
this fact they could understand that the three
men meant to avoid from being seen as much
as was possible while heading for their destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Hugh was satisfied with the way things
were going. For a little while he had secretly
confessed at being worried; that was when he
feared the men might be making for some station
on the railroad; because once they managed
to reach a city, the difficulty of finding
them would be increased many fold. Scouts
are more at home in the great open than on
stone pavements, where most of their knowledge
of woodcraft would be wasted.</p>
<p>This was of the past now, for the country
seemed to be getting more and more lonely as
they continued to advance.</p>
<p>Sometimes Ralph met trouble and had to
bring his reserve stock of cunning into play
before he was able to go on. This generally
happened at places where the nature of the
ground made the trail almost indistinguishable
to the human eye. Perhaps, at such times,
Billy Worth might have been caught wishing
once more that they had a dog along with the
ability to follow a scent; for such an acquisition
to their force would have solved these
riddles faster than Ralph was able to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in every instance, the delay
was only temporary, and each in turn served to
impress more firmly upon the minds of the
boys the great lesson of preparedness they
were learning.</p>
<p>Only for Ralph&rsquo;s taking such pains to study
up along these lines they would be finding
themselves hopelessly beaten in the endeavor
to track down the abductors of little Reuben.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they mean to keep on going all
night long?&rdquo; Blake Merton remarked to the
boy on his left, when there could be no doubt
about their having covered a good two and a
half miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we ought to be as able to keep it
going as long as those men,&rdquo; said Tom Sherwood.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of scouts training at
long-distance walking, mountain climbing, and
all that sort of thing, if they can&rsquo;t beat out a
pack of men who have never practised such
stunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently there was no answer to that
query; at least Blake Merton did not appear
to find any, for he relapsed into silence.</p>
<p>All this occurred while they had been surrounded
by darkness. What lay beyond they
could only guess at; except when the outlines
of tree-tops were seen against the sky there
was no means of telling where the horizon lay.</p>
<p>Far in the distance they saw lights from
time to time, but as they progressed further
along on their journey even these failed to
show. This would seem to indicate that the
country must be getting more and more lonely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hide-out they&rsquo;re making for, Hugh,&rdquo;
Ralph declared for the third time. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to strike pay-dirt sooner or later. And
right now, if you look ahead, you can see a
dim sort of light. I wouldn&rsquo;t be much surprised
if that was it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the other boys heard this assertion
made, they quickened their pace in a perceptible
degree; their actions were much more
lively, and it could be seen that the pursuit
had taken on new vim.</p>
<p>As they drew steadily closer to the dim light
they found reason to believe that Ralph was
stating the truth when he predicted speedy
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be coming from a window, like
there might be a shack of some kind there!&rdquo;
one scout ventured, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look here, will you, we&rsquo;ve struck a
road!&rdquo; observed another, exercising the same
amount of caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s an old and abandoned one, let me
tell you, Billy. See how the grass has grown
all over it. They must have built a new road
some years ago, and left this one high and dry.
That house ahead of us, where the light comes
from, was once facing on this same road, and
now it&rsquo;s left high and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; Billy declared, &ldquo;it must
have been abandoned by the people who lived
there when the old road was given up. They
moved to new quarters; and these men, looking
around for a good hiding-place, located
this shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh at that point asked the others not to
even whisper any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve marked this spot so we could find it
again if we wanted to,&rdquo; he explained to them.
&ldquo;You notice that Ralph isn&rsquo;t using his torch
any more. He thinks it might be dangerous
if anyone happened to be looking this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do we creep up so as to take a peek in
at the shack then, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the program,&rdquo; the scout master
told them. &ldquo;Remember, everybody, not to
speak a word unless you&rsquo;re forced to, and then
let it be as soft as the night wind whispering
through the leaves. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>They were wild with eagerness as they
obeyed their leader. Each scout mentally resolved
that it would not be set down at his
door if their finely-laid plans missed connections,
and success failed to reward their efforts.</p>
<p>In this way, then, they moved along, and
drew close up to the house on the abandoned
public highway, from which that light shone
dimly through the dirty window sash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">AT THE END OF THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh had already learned the nature of the
building upon which they had come while following
the trail of the three disgruntled former
guards who had been let go when the sheriff
took charge of affairs in the strike zone.</p>
<p>It was an old, tumbledown structure, and,
from what he could see of it in the semi-darkness
of the night, the scout master believed it
had formerly been used as a residence and
blacksmith shop combined.</p>
<p>At some time in the dim past, no doubt, the
brawny smith who dwelt there had made a fair
living by handling his share of the traffic of
wagons that rumbled past the place. The
building of the new road had left him high
and dry, so that it became necessary for him
to seek another location, perhaps at some
crossroads, in order to continue his vocation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Of course all this just flashed through the
mind of the scout master when he saw what
manner of building it was they had come upon.
He could not spare the time at present to look
into it any deeper. There was work to be
done, and, if they hoped to come out of this
affair with credit to themselves as worthy
scouts, they must devote their entire time and
attention to the task in hand.</p>
<p>First of all they wished to ascertain who
was inside that old ramshackle building where
the elements had played at hide-and-seek, no
doubt, for many a year after its abandonment
as a habitation and bustling place of business.</p>
<p>To accomplish this they crept toward the
window where that dim light shone through
the dusty window-panes. Miraculous to relate,
these still remained whole, perhaps because
there had come along no lively boy capable of
hurling a stone with accurate aim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>In cases of this kind, when the scouts were
out in force, they had a systematic way of
doing things. Those who were recognized as
their leaders must be accorded the first privilege.
Consequently there was no jostling and
crowding now, as they made toward that coveted
place of observation. While every fellow
would be glad of a chance to see, he was
ready to await his turn, if need be.</p>
<p>It was with considerable eagerness that
Hugh and Ralph, having been given first
chance by virtue of their recent labors, raised
their heads and glued their eyes to the soiled
glass.</p>
<p>Only by means of this close contact were
they able to see at all through the small and
almost opaque window panes. Several candles
were burning on a table. These had been
placed in as many bottles to serve in place of
candlesticks, of which there was apparently a
dearth in the old place.</p>
<p>The window belonged to a room adjoining
the shed where in past days the smith had had
his forge and conducted his horseshoeing
business. It may have served as a combined
dining and sitting-room in those happy times;
but, if so, it must have been a rather dismal
place. Still, there were two other windows the
boys noticed, though they had wooden shutters
closed on them. The third one had been
torn from its moorings in some wild gale, and
lay on the ground in fragments, which was
possibly the reason the last window had not
also been screened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Except a rickety little table, not worth taking
away, and a bench, there was not a single
article of furniture in the room. But then,
what more could hardly be expected in connection
with a long-ago, abandoned house?</p>
<p>It told Hugh that those who were now occupying
the place did not expect to stay there,
and had no means of making themselves even
halfway comfortable.</p>
<p>Having found a section in the lower part
of the pane where there chanced to be a little
less grime than usual, he was now able to see
better. There were moving figures in the
room, one, two, yes, three of them. They
were all men, and this must have struck Hugh
as a most suggestive fact, since they had been
following a trio of fugitives for the last hour
and a half, perhaps more.</p>
<p>Ralph was feeling for his ear, and, understanding
that the other wished to whisper
something, the scout master bent his head
lower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them!&rdquo; was all Ralph spoke, but it was
quite enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Hugh did not need to cudgel his brains to
understand to what the other was referring.
He knew Ralph, in some way, recognized the
men inside the deserted smithy as the trio of
guards who had come back after being dismissed
by the sheriff. Hugh guessed from
this that Ralph must have found a much
cleaner section of window pane than it had
been his luck to run across.</p>
<p>Hugh again tried to discover what the inmates
of the room were doing, for he had before
that seen them moving around as though
busily engaged; and, even the sound of heavy
voices, accompanied by hoarse laughter, had
drifted to his ears.</p>
<p>At first Hugh was puzzled to account for
the apparently strange act of two of the
men who were moving about. He saw them
open bundles they had doubtless carried with
them to the old building. These seemed to
contain clothes, for they held them up. They
also made some sort of comment, as though
inviting the criticism of the third man, who
was smoking a pipe and taking it easy, sitting
on the bench, with one foot raised, and his
back against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>It would appear as though the men might
be thinking of opening an old clothes shop,
for all that they took out of the bundles looked
dilapidated. Hugh could not be quite sure, but
somehow it struck him that he had seen just
such clothes among the foreign workers.</p>
<p>When he saw one of the men hold up a colored
handkerchief, such as the women belonging
to the strikers universally wore, his suspicions
became a conviction. There was a deep
and dark design in what the two men were
engaged in doing; it was not the idle horseplay
it might appear on the surface.</p>
<p>Hugh remembered of lately reading how
unscrupulous prospectors have many times
been known to &ldquo;salt&rdquo; a mine deemed worthless,
so that it could be sold to some innocent,
trusting Eastern capitalist. Well, these rascals
were doing something of the same sort
then and there, only in this case it was their
design to unload the entire ignominy of the
evil deed they had just carried out on to the
shoulders of the wretched strikers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>They had managed to secure some of the
garments belonging in the foreign settlement,
perhaps by raiding a clothes line; and these
garments they meant to scatter about the
place. When, later, directed by some clue
over the wire, perhaps, the authorities hurried
to the old smithy and found the stolen child
there, they would never have a single doubt
but that the place had been occupied by a
party of foreigners, and in this way the crime
would be laid at the door of the strikers who
had reason to hate Mr. Campertown.</p>
<p>It was a miserable sort of game, Hugh
thought, as he continued to watch the way the
three hilarious ex-guards were carrying on,
all of them having perhaps been drinking more
than was good for them, as there were flasks
in sight on the table.</p>
<p>He could not understand just how they expected
to profit by the deal; but possibly they
had this all planned out; or it might be that
revenge was all they wanted, which was meant
to fall heavily upon both the strikers and the
millionaire.</p>
<p>Hugh had seen quite enough. He believed
the child was in that other room beyond the
door he had noticed in the wall. Several times
he had discovered one of the men pointing in
that direction, as though he might be referring
to the innocent object of their treacherous raid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Hugh backed away and allowed others to
take his place, so that by degrees all of the
scouts could feel that they had been given a
fair show.</p>
<p>The next thing was how to go about the
task of frightening the three men off, and preventing
them from carrying the child in addition.
Hugh was figuring all this over in his
mind as he waited for the last detachment to
creep up and take a look through the grimy
window panes.</p>
<p>Of course, there need be no great effort made
to come in contact with the desperate trio.
Their capture was not so much what the scouts
were after as the recovery of the child.</p>
<p>That was why Hugh began figuring in his
mind upon a little scheme by means of which
he believed they might beat the enemy at their
own game. If these men could crawl through
a convenient window and run away with the
boy, possibly the resourceful scouts might
adopt the same stratagem with a chance for
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Was there a window to the other room, and,
if so, would they find it fastened up by a barricade
in the shape of a heavy wooden shutter?
The thought had hardly appealed to Hugh
before he was drawing Ralph with him around
the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game now?&rdquo; whispered that
surprised scout, though he did not offer the
slightest objection to being towed along, for
he felt sure Hugh had hit on some clever device
that might lead to the confusion of the
foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a window,&rdquo; replied the
other, as near his ear as it was possible for
him to place his lips. &ldquo;One opening into that
other room. I think the boy must be in there.
We can give them tit for tat if it&rsquo;s possible to
get inside and carry off the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Hugh, don&rsquo;t you believe they&rsquo;re meaning
to abandon him, after setting that trap
with all those dago things?&rdquo; asked Ralph,
proving that he, as well as the scout master,
had guessed the true reason for the actions
of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it looks like it, but I&rsquo;m afraid they
may change their minds. &lsquo;A bird in the hand
is better than two in the bush,&rsquo; Ralph.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right, Hugh; do whatever
you think is best,&rdquo; was what Ralph told the
scout leader.</p>
<p>It generally happened that way. Hugh&rsquo;s
plans appealed to his chums in an irresistible
fashion. If there was some honest opposition
at first, it usually gave way after he had disclosed
his hand, and shown the real value of
his idea.</p>
<p>The window was soon found, and, as Hugh
expected, there was a heavy wooden shutter
guarding it. At first sight this would appear
to have been a serious setback to any design
the scouts might entertain looking to effecting
an entrance. Hugh started an immediate investigation,
and a satisfied grunt told his comrade
that he had made a pleasing discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much!&rdquo; whispered the scout
master, as he softly began to draw the wooden
blind back.</p>
<p>Like nearly everything else about the old
rookery, it was in a dilapidated condition, and
could not be securely fastened on the inside.
The men may have drawn it shut, so as to conceal
their light as much as possible, but found
no occasion to spend any precious time in trying
to mend the broken blind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>As he continued to draw this obstruction
back, Hugh began to see light within. He
knew how this came, remembering that the
door between the two rooms had been partly
open.</p>
<p>Gluing his eye to the cracked glass, he
tried to discover evidences of the stolen child&rsquo;s
presence. There was some sort of bundle on
the floor in one corner, and, while he could
not just make it out in the dim light, he found
reason to believe this must be little Reuben,
still fast asleep.</p>
<p>The next thing on the scouts&rsquo; program
consisted of forcing the window and gaining
an entrance. Hugh made a little test, and
found that he could move the sash, although
only with an effort.</p>
<p>Ralph came to his assistance, having his
hunting knife in hand, the point of which he
inserted under the obstinate sash. This proved
to be the right trick, and things were moving
splendidly when there came an unexpected interruption.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>One of the scouts had the misfortune to
sneeze violently; and, alarmed by the sound,
the men inside could be heard making wildly
for the door, evidently with the intention of
effecting their escape from what might turn
out to be a sudden trap!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">WELL WORTH WHILE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Get around to the door, everybody; they&rsquo;re
trying to escape!&rdquo; shouted Hugh, as he whirled
away from the window that had been engaging
his attention.</p>
<p>Ralph was alongside as he turned the corner
of the old smithy. The other scouts had
hardly known what to do, although several of
the most active seemed to be in motion, headed
for the exit of the old house. These were Alec
and Bud and big Tom Sherwood, and the trio
presented quite a formidable phalanx. They
turned the corner just in time to cut off the
flight of the last of the abductors, who had
tripped and fallen inside the room, thus delaying
his departure for a few seconds.</p>
<p>The other pair could be heard pounding off
in rapid order, thoroughly frightened, for they
had heard the cries that were coming from
the boys, and of course imagined that the sheriff&rsquo;s
posse had arrived on their heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>There was enough light escaping from the
open door for the third rascal to get a glimpse
of khaki uniforms on the flitting figures that
formed a cordon across his path. No doubt
he believed on the spur of the moment that the
militia must have been sent to the scene of
the late riot to keep the peace, and that one of
their first efforts had been to run himself and
his fellow kidnappers down.</p>
<p>The boys assailed him without hesitation.
As scouts they had long ago learned the great
value of assuming the offensive, if it ever became
necessary to do any fighting, which is
not often supposed to be the case.</p>
<p>When Hugh and Ralph and the rest of the
troop came hurrying around the corner they
saw a struggling mass which no one could
fully make out in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw your light on them, Ralph!&rdquo; ordered
the scout master instantly.</p>
<p>As soon as this was done they could see
that their three comrades were hanging on
desperately to the man, who seemed to be doing
everything in his power to hurl them aside,
though without avail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Alec had seized hold of one arm, while Bud
hung to the other, and Tom Sherwood managed
to get his arms twined around the fellow&rsquo;s
thick neck, so that he was beginning to
exercise quite some pressure. At least the man
looked fiery red, as if his breathing had become
difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pile on, and throw him down, boys!&rdquo; Hugh
called out, and willingly as many of the others
obeyed as could manage to get a grip on the
object of their attention.</p>
<p>By sheer weight of numbers the fellow was
borne to the earth and rolled over on his face.
Then his hands were drawn behind his back,
and Billy Worth, producing a stout cord,
lashed them together. After that he was unable
to make any more trouble, or even try
and effect his escape, for no one can run with
any degree of swiftness when his arms are
drawn tightly behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him get up, and keep him held tight,&rdquo;
said Hugh. &ldquo;Come with me, Ralph, and fetch
your light along. Nurse Jones, you&rsquo;re in this,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>They hurried into the house and quickly
reached the second room. Before Hugh or
Ralph could reach the object on the floor,
Nurse Jones had darted forward and was
bending over it. As she arose, they saw that
she was holding the limp figure of little Reuben
in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails him?&rdquo; asked Ralph in trembling
tones, as he saw that despite all the noise and
confusion the child did not appear to pay any
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given him some narcotic, for I can
get the scent of it,&rdquo; replied Nurse Jones. &ldquo;It
was done to keep him quiet while they were
carrying him out of the office, for they must
have been afraid of the sheriff and his men.
But the effect is wearing away fast now. He
begins to stir, and&mdash;there, you can see, his
eyelids are quivering. He will wake up immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had she spoken than the eyes of the
child were seen to open. He stared up into
the face of Nurse Jones as though bewildered.
She held him tightly to her breast, and bending
down pressed affectionate kisses on his
cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>There must have been something responsive
about her action that aroused his childish
confidence, for almost immediately his little
arms were around her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Ralph Kenyon, quite
overcome by the sight, and feeling that he must
give voice to his excitement, or act like a baby
and cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go outside with him, for the rest of
the boys will want to have a share in the victory!&rdquo;
suggested Hugh, always thinking of
others.</p>
<p>Loud were the cheers that arose when they
joined the rest of the troop. The dejected
prisoner must have realized more than ever
the bitterness of the moment, as he saw those
gallant boys swinging their hats wildly above
their heads, and giving vent to their feelings
in rousing shouts.</p>
<p>So they once more turned their faces back
over the old trail. Hugh remembered that
Mr. Campertown was suffering dreadfully,
and he wanted to have Nurse Jones put the
rescued child in his grandfather&rsquo;s arms, because,
somehow, that seemed a fitting end to
the program according to Hugh&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>While there was little reason to anticipate
any sort of attack from the other pair of
alarmed plotters, still the scouts were not
meaning to be taken off their guard.</p>
<p>They formed a solid phalanx around Hugh,
who was taking his turn at carrying the child,
and kept those handy clubs ready for instant
use. It turned out that there was no necessity
for this arrangement, since in the end they
arrived at the works without having met with
the slightest hindrance.</p>
<p>There were lights within the big office, and,
having placed little Reuben in the arms of
Nurse Jones, Hugh led the laughing and chattering
lot of scouts within. The sheriff and
Mr. Campertown had evidently been unable to
sleep, and must have been trying to lay some
new plan of campaign at the time the bustle
at the door announced the arrival of the boys.</p>
<p>Straight up to the millionaire walked Nurse
Jones, holding little Reuben, while into the
room after her thronged the entire pack of
scouts, every fellow wild to witness what was
scheduled to take place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Of course the first thing Mr. Campertown
did was to clutch the boy and squeeze him in
his arms. But almost immediately afterward
he was seen to be staring in the pretty and
flushed face of Nurse Jones. In that wonderful
moment something like the amazing truth
must have rushed into his mind, which would
account for what he started to say in a trembling
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me your name was Nurse Jones,
child, but surely you have the eyes and features
of my first born, Allan. You are, you
must be, a Campertown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Jones nodded her head in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Norma, the same as my
father&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
<p>Mr. Campertown was as white as a sheet,
as some of the boys expressed it afterward,
but his eyes were fastened eagerly upon the
flushed face of this granddaughter whom he
had never known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is from your hands I have received
my little darling Reuben,&rdquo; he almost groaned,
as though he felt terribly humbled and contrite.
&ldquo;It must be intended for a punishment
on my head for my cruelty to your father and
mother in the long ago. Tell me, are you alone
in the world, or do either or both of them yet
live?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father is still living, sir, though in very
poor health, and in need. He has always said
that it was through no fault of his the estrangement
came about, and in all these years
he would not hear of my ever trying to see you
or communicate with you. He is firmly convinced
that if ever this unhappy trouble was
to be bridged over, the initial step must come
from his father. He has the Campertown
stubbornness, sir, which will stay with him to
the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it <i>will</i> come from me!&rdquo; declared the
millionaire firmly. &ldquo;I have repented of my
folly long, long ago, but never knew what had
become of poor Allan. To-morrow, my dear
granddaughter, you shall take me to him, and
we must be reconciled. I am an old man now,
and with but few years more to live. I hope
to make up in part for what you and my son
have suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned to Hugh and shook him by
the hand. Indeed he insisted on doing the
same with each and every one of the scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will see you in the morning, my gallant
boys,&rdquo; he said, as they prepared to withdraw.
&ldquo;Depend on it, I have not forgotten that I
made you a promise if you succeeded in restoring
my darling to my arms. I can give a pretty
good guess what it is you mean to ask of me,
and I am more than ready to grant it in full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a happy group of scouts who wended
their way back to the camp, where the whole
story of their latest achievement had to be
retold to Harold and Monkey Stallings, whom
they found sitting up and waiting for them.</p>
<p>Indeed, they had reason to feel satisfied with
what they had accomplished while on this their
first outing of the summer. Not only had they
been instrumental in instituting a scout field
hospital, and taking care of the victims of the
conflict between the strikers and the armed
guards of the cement plant; but now they were
apparently destined to be chiefly instrumental
in bringing an era of industrial peace to that
disturbed section.</p>
<p>They could certainly go back to the home
town when their camping trip was over with
the pleasing knowledge that a good fortune
had allowed them to be of tremendous service
to their fellow men; and that is the cardinal
principle actuating the ambition of every true
scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>There promised to be very little sleep that
night in the scouts&rsquo; camp. Everybody was
more or less excited after the strange happenings
that had so lately taken place.</p>
<p>Questions without number were showered
on those fortunate enough to have taken part
in the adventures connected with the riot at
the cement works, and the coming of the Red
Cross ambulance.</p>
<p>To Harold the whole thing was a revelation
indeed, and he felt that it had been a privilege
to be connected with the scouts whose assistance
had turned out to be so appreciated.</p>
<p>Monkey Stallings was almost inconsolable
because he had not been able to join the group
that went out to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now all of you are slated for the bronze
medal that I&rsquo;ve always hoped to wear some of
these fine days,&rdquo; he complained, &ldquo;and it leaves
me out in the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the only consolation they could
offer him was that his time was apt to come
later on. Monkey Stallings was perhaps the
only unhappy chap sitting alongside that cheery
campfire, for the rest felt elated over their recent
good luck, and it was only with considerable
effort that Hugh managed to chase them
off to their blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>All were up early in the morning, for the
day promised to be a lively one with them.</p>
<p>Hugh and several of his chums meant to go
over to the works, and have a plain talk with
Mr. Campertown. While his heart was feeling
soft over the wonderful revelations of the preceding
night, Hugh believed was the time to
secure favors for the strikers.</p>
<p>Besides, the manufacturer had as good as
half promised that he was ready to hear all
Hugh had to say; and the hearty squeeze which
he had given the boy&rsquo;s hand told the latter that
the land was fallow, and ready for the plow.</p>
<p>Of course they had the usual rollicking time
in preparing breakfast for the crowd. There
had come over a bountiful amount of stores
with the compliments of Mr. Campertown.
This was pretty good evidence that he did not
mean to keep those guards on duty any longer,
feeding them inside the works. At least Hugh
looked at it that way, and Arthur seemed of
the same opinion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all going to come out the finest anybody
could ever dream of,&rdquo; the latter declared, as
a party of them talked it over shortly after
breakfast was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to think of Nurse Jones turning out to
be his grandchild after all; and she the finest
young woman we&rsquo;ve met this long time,&rdquo; remarked
Billy Worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect I know a party who agrees with
you there, Billy,&rdquo; chuckled Alec; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
the young Red Cross surgeon. I could see how
Dr. Richter&rsquo;s eyes were fastened on Nurse
Jones as if he could nearly eat her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s none of our affair,&rdquo; replied
Billy; &ldquo;and she looks sweet enough to eat, if
you&rsquo;ll take it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hugh got ready to go over to the
works under the belief that Mr. Campertown
could be seen, he selected just Billy, Alec and
Arthur to accompany him.</p>
<p>Seeing some of the rest look deeply disappointed,
the patrol leader felt that he ought to
explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;d like to ask you all to go with
me, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the office is small; and
besides, Mr. Campertown mightn&rsquo;t like to see
a crowd. You know this is a delicate subject
we&rsquo;re meaning to talk over with him, and his
private business in the bargain. But we&rsquo;ll
promise to tell you everything. And then again,
Nurse Jones has promised to take dinner with
us to-day, so you want to tidy up the camp,
and lay out a menu that&rsquo;ll do us credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Hugh and the other three went off. They
saw that everything seemed to be very quiet
over in the foreign settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the padrone has brought them to
their senses,&rdquo; said Billy; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a lucky thing,
too, because they&rsquo;re going to win the strike.
The very thing that seemed to be a calamity
for the poor fellows has proved the stepping-stone
for a big advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better still,&rdquo; added Hugh, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a new
Mr. Campertown now at the head of the cement
works. By that I mean he&rsquo;s seen a light,
and guided by the love of his granddaughter
never again will he be the stern employer he&rsquo;s
been in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand good thing all around,&rdquo; said
Alec, &ldquo;and for one I&rsquo;m glad to have had even
a small part in helping things get where they
are right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>At the works things seemed to be going on,
but to the delight of the scouts they saw men
working on the stockade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you think, they&rsquo;re knocking
the whole thing flat!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, as if
the sight astonished him.</p>
<p>As for Hugh, he felt that this was a sure
sign peace was going to reign in those works
from that hour on. Contented workmen would
have no cause for grievance against a just and
generous employer; and guards armed with
deadly Winchesters would never again be
known in the Campertown establishment.</p>
<p>They found the gentleman seated in his little
office. He was looking a hundred per cent.
better than when they last saw him, and even
smiled genially as he shook each one of the
four boys by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of course just what you want to see
me for this morning, boys,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;and
in the start I mean to tell you that I&rsquo;ve seen a
great light. This bloody business would never
have occurred if I had been present; but all the
same I&rsquo;m partly responsible for the trouble,
because I refused to arbitrate with my old
hands, or investigate their plea that they were
nearly starving on the new wage plan. And
I&rsquo;ve sent for the padrone to make an agreement
with him restoring wages to the point they
were before the strike.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Enthusiastic Billy jumped up and gave a
hurrah before he remembered where he was.
Then he dropped back in his seat looking confused.
But Mr. Campertown only laughed
and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say right here,&rdquo; he remarked
seriously, &ldquo;that I consider the coming of you
scouts the finest thing that could have happened.
Not only did you prove yourselves made
of the right stuff by taking care of those poor
sufferers, and winning golden opinions from
the surgeon, Dr. Richter, for whom I already
have a high regard; but you also did me two
of the greatest favors possible. You saved my
little grandson, who is the apple of my eye, and
also brought about a reunion between Norma,
Allan and myself. I shall probably never be
able to thank you enough for doing all these
fine things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were actually tears in his eyes, too,
when he was going around and again squeezing
the hand of each and every scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Just then the old padrone came in, and there
was a piteous look of entreaty on his face that
made the boys feel more satisfied than ever
with what they had done.</p>
<p>No sooner had Mr. Campertown informed
the padrone what he meant to do than the old
man fell on his knees, and seizing the gentleman&rsquo;s
hand covered it with kisses, as he called
down the blessings of Heaven on his head.</p>
<p>None of them could doubt after that his sincerity,
or that he had the interests of his people
deeply bedded in his heart when he tried
to pilot them along paths of peace.</p>
<p>Of course after that the sheriff and his
posse had nothing further to do. Before he
left the scene, however, the peace officer made
it a point to visit the camp of the scouts and
tell them what a high opinion he had come to
have of the movement with which they were
affiliated. Up to that time he had rather opposed
it, but from that day when he had had
his eyes opened, it had appealed to him more
and more strongly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have some boys who will be only too glad
to start a troop in their neighborhood,&rdquo; he
said at parting, &ldquo;and so you see how far-reaching
your influence for good can go. Keep up
the work, lads, and the next generation of
Americans will be the finest this glorious country
of ours has ever produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nurse Jones came over, too, and had dinner
with the scouts. She thanked them with tears
in her pretty eyes for all they had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are just starting for the city, Grandfather
Campertown, Reuben and I,&rdquo; were her
parting words, &ldquo;and the future looks very
bright for us all. My poor father, too, can
now be able to enjoy something of life, since
it is money he needs most of all in order to
restore his health. And we will never, never
forget you, Reuben and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She even pinned her Red Cross badge on
Hugh&rsquo;s sleeve, for him to keep as a reminder
of these strenuous times when he and his comrades
assisted the hospital corps in their duties
in caring for the wounded strikers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>During the rest of their stay in camp the
boys saw more or less of Dr. Richter, and
grew to like him very much. When, in time,
they set their faces toward the far-distant
home-town, they carried a new fund of experiences
and memories along with them that
would doubtless add to the general esteem in
which Oakvale Troop was now held by the
people among whom they dwelt.</p>
<p>That their activities in the way of usefulness
had not yet reached a limit may be understood
from the title of the volume that follows
this; and if you care to continue the many
pleasant friendships formed in these pages,
you can do so by procuring &ldquo;The Boy Scouts
as County Fair Guides.&rdquo;</p>

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
